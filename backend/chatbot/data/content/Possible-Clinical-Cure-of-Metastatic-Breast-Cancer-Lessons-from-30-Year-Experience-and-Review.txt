From improved survival to potential cure
in patients with metastatic breast cancer

Possible clinical cure of metastatic breast cancer: lessons from our
30-year experience with oligometastatic breast cancer patients
and literature review



Abstract
Background Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is generally
incurable. However, 10–20-year relapse-free survival of
MBC is approximately 2%, implying that at least a small
subset of MBC patients achieve prolonged survival. We
therefore analyzed long-term outcome in a particular subset, i.e., oligometastatic breast cancer (OMBC).




retrospectively analyzed. OMBC was identified as: one or 2
organs involved with metastatic lesions (excluding the
primary lesion resectable by surgery), fewer than 5 lesions
per metastasized organ, and lesion diameter less than 5 cm.
Patients were generally treated with systemic chemotherapy first, and those who achieved complete response (CR)
or partial response (PR) were further treated, if applicable,
with local therapy (surgical or radiation therapy) to maintain CR or to induce no evidence of clinical disease (NED),
with additional systemic therapy.
Results Median follow-up duration was 103 (6–329)
months. Single or 2 organs were involved in, respectively,
44 (59%) and 31 (41%) cases with metastatic lesions, 48%
of which were visceral. In cases where effects of systemic
therapy, possibly in combination with other treatments,
were evaluated (N = 68), CR or PR was achieved in 33
(48.5%) or 32 (47.1%), respectively, with overall response
rate (ORR: CR ? PR) of 95.6% (N = 65). In cases
receiving multidisciplinary treatment (N = 75), CR or
NED (CR/NED), or PR was induced in 48 (64.0%) or 23
(30.7%) cases, respectively, with ORR (CR/NED ? PR) of
94.7% (N = 71). CR rates (60.5%) with systemic therapy
and CR/NED rates (79.5%) with multidisciplinary treatment were significantly better in subjects with a single
involved organ than in those with two involved organs
(P = 0.047 and 0.002, systemic only or multidisciplinary
treatments, respectively).
Medians estimated by Kaplan–Meier method were: overall
survival (OS) of 185.0 months and relapse-free interval
(RFI) of 48.0 months. Estimated outcomes were: OS rates
(OSR) of 59.2% at 10 years and 34.1% at 20 years, and
relapse-free rates (RFR) of 27.4% at 10 years and 20 years.
No disease progression was observed after 101.0 months as
RFR. Cases with single organ involvement (N = 44)
showed significantly better outcomes (OSR of 73% at

Breast Cancer

10 years and 52% at 20 years, RFR of 42% at 10 years and
20 years). Those who received local therapies (N = 35)
also showed better prognosis: OSR of 82% at 10 years and
53% at 20 years, RFR of 38% at 10 years and 20 years.
Three cases (4%) survived for their lifetime without relapse
after achieving CR or NED, our definition of clinical cure.
Multivariate analysis revealed factors favoring better
prognosis as: none for OS, and single organ involvement
with metastasis, administration of local treatment, and
shorter disease-free interval (DFI) (P = 0.030, 0.039, and
0.042, respectively) for RFR. Outcomes in OMBC in literature were OSR of 35–73% at 10 years and 26–52% at
20 years, and RFR of 27–42% at 10 years and 26–42% at
20 years.
Conclusions The present analyses clearly indicate that
OMBC is a distinct subgroup with long-term prognosis
superior to MBC, with reasonable provability for clinical
cure. Further prospective studies to better characterize
OMBC are warranted to improve prognosis in MBC.

Introduction
Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) encompasses both primary
breast cancers with distant metastases and those recurrent
after surgical intervention. Unlike early-stage breast cancers, cure is rarely achieved in patients with MBC [1], and
therefore current treatment for MBC is focused mainly on
prolonging patient life and improving and maintaining
quality of life (QOL). Median survival for MBC is variably
reported but generally short, e.g., 8–24 months [1],
18–24 months [1–3], or as long as 2–4 years [4, 5]. Data on
long-term survival beyond 3–5 years are limited [1–3], but
20-year survivals are reported as low as 1–3% [1, 4, 6].
However, development of new approaches in the last
decade, using new hormone therapy formulations, chemotherapy agents, and drugs targeting specific molecules,
brought hope for improved survival of MBC [7, 8]. A
systematic review of results from various randomized trials
on therapy regimens for MBC, including 370 trials with a
total of 54,189 patients treated between 1973 and 2007,
was performed, and survival data of 26,031 patients were
obtained. A meta-analysis in this study indeed demonstrated that transition of systemic treatment regimes has
stepwisely achieved significant improvement in survival
rate of MBC over the last 30 years [9]. The improved
efficacy of systemic therapy would ultimately lead to
clinical cure of MBC, through increasing rate of complete
response (CR) and prolonging no evidence of clinical
disease (NED) following local treatments.



On the other hand, definition for ‘‘cure’’ of the breast
cancers has yet been unanimously defined. Some suggest
cure of breast cancer as a condition where cancer cells are
eradicated, permitting a normal lifespan without threat of
recurrence [3, 10] or without cancer-related complaints
[11], whereas others consider that all cancer cells do not
have to be destroyed in ‘‘cure,’’ but rather that disease must
be rendered harmless (without clinically significant adverse
effects) for prolonged periods [2]. In the present article, we
define cure as clinical cure, in which systemic therapy has
induced complete response (CR) or local therapy maintained no evidence of clinical disease (NED), i.e., sustained
relapse-free interval (RFI) and no recurrence of cancer
after CR/NED induction during the entire lifespan of the
patient [12].
Factors that affect prognosis of MBC include: number of
recurrence sites, tumor cell numbers, patient age and performance status (PS), disease-free interval (DFI) after
surgical intervention, and tumor biology [grade, estrogen
receptor status, human epidermal growth factor receptor
type 2 (HER2) status] [3, 13]. Long-term survivors are
usually young and have excellent PS with limited metastatic lesions [4]. Also, CR is more efficiently achieved in
MBC with low tumor burden and good PS, and in those
whose metastatic lesions are predominantly in soft tissues.
Furthermore, survival periods for those in whom CR is
established are significantly longer than those without CR
[1, 14, 15]. In particular, MBC with only a few metastatic
lesions is categorized as oligometastatic breast cancer
(OMBC). In general, one or more organs are involved by a
single metastatic lesion in OMBC [2, 11, 13, 16]. OMBC is
a new paradigm proposed by Hellman in 1995 [16]. Due to
its relatively limited nature, oligometastases either de novo
or following systemic treatment could be removed by local
therapy. In cases with more advanced lesions with possible
subclinical systemic spreading, addition of systemic therapy would be further required. Therefore, the paradigm
proposes that surgical and/or radiation therapies targeting
solitary oligometastatic lesions could potentially cure
oligometastases either alone or in combination with systemic therapy. To date, oligometastases denote lesions with
limited metastases, solitary metastasis, isolated metastases,
or minimal metastases. However, OMBC has not yet been
widely recognized since its proposal in 1995, and despite
many reports that suggest benefits of aggressive multidisciplinary treatment to induce long-term CR or cure [1],
little data are available regarding clinical outcome, particularly for long-term observations, of OMBC following
therapeutic interventions. OMBC is often surgically
excised or treated with radiation, and consequent conditions without lesions are defined as stage IV-NED (no
evidence of clinical disease). Two approaches are possible
for treatment strategies in achieving long-lasting CR/NED

123

and ultimate cure of OMBC. One is multidisciplinary
treatment that first performs local therapy to remove clinically detectable lesions to establish disease-free status, i.e.,
stage IV-NED, after which postsurgical systemic treatment
similar to adjuvant therapy in the case of primary breast
cancer is administered. Outcomes from this approach in the
longest and largest-scale study for 30 years conducted in
M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) were reported
[17]. This approach stresses the characteristics of OMBC as
a local disease. In contrast, the other approach emphasizes a
systemic nature of breast cancer and therefore treats OMBC
first with systemic therapies (chemo-, hormone, and
molecular-targeted therapies), followed by local therapy
targeting remaining lesions, mainly in responders to the
initial systemic treatment, to achieve prolonged CR and
subsequent clinical cure. We have adopted the latter
approach in treating breast cancer patents in our institution
since 1980. In this multidisciplinary approach, the systemic
therapy rather resembles neoadjuvant therapy for de novo
primary breast cancer. In the present article, we retrospectively analyze our clinical experience in the past 30 years.
To our knowledge, the present article is the first to date
reporting therapeutic outcome, particularly for the long
term, by the systemic therapeutic strategy in OMBC, along
with a systematic review of previous literature.
The primary purpose of the present analyses is to assess
the long-term maintenance rate of CR/NED, an equivalent
to clinical cure, in patients with OMBC. Secondly, we aim
to evaluate factors that affect prognosis of OMBC. We also
review literature on long-term survival rates in MBC and
therapeutic outcomes of OMBC that have achieved longterm CR/NED, along with our experience, to address issues
that would benefit our future approach to establish clinical
cure in MBC.

Patients and methods
Patient selection
We performed retrospective analyses of cases of OMBC
selected from the MBC patients treated mainly with chemotherapy-based systemic treatment as front-line therapy
in our institution during the last 30 years between April
1980 and March 2010.
Patients who met all 3 following criteria as a modified,
milder definition were considered as having OMBC: number of organs involved with metastatic lesions other than
those with primary lesions (for which curative surgery was
considered possible) of 2 or less; number of metastatic
lesions per organ of 5 or less (in lungs or bones that were too
small or unclear for detection by diagnostic imaging,
approximately 10 or less); lesion diameter of 5 cm or less.

123

Breast Cancer (2012) 19:218–237

Patients were excluded from the present analyses if: the
patient had previously received intensive chemotherapy,
such as those whose regimen included substantial dose and/
or intensity of anthracyclines or taxanes to their metastatic
lesions prior to study enrollment; the lesion was a recurrence within 1 year after adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy including anthracyclines or taxanes; patients
presenting pulmonary lymphangitis carcinomatosis, symptomatic brain metastasis, dysfunction of critical organs such
as bone marrow, heart, liver, or kidney, simultaneous active
cancers of separate origin, or any other serious health
problems. Patients were fully informed regarding their
therapeutic decisions, and each patient’s consent was
obtained and recorded prior to initiating treatment. For
those demonstrating sensitivity to hormone therapy, the
general recommendation for hormone therapy as initial
systemic treatment for OMBC was explained, and only
those who preferred to receive chemotherapy prior to hormone treatment were treated with chemotherapy as initial
treatment, since an algorithm for treatment of recurrent
breast cancer was reported by Hortobagyi in 1998 [18].
Treatments and evaluation of responses
In general, eligible patients received systemic chemotherapy first, and responders who achieved CR or partial
response (PR) were, if applicable, further treated with local
therapy (surgery or radiation) to sustain CR and to induce
NED by removing the remaining tumor mass. In addition,
systemic therapy (chemotherapy and hormone or molecular-targeted therapy, if applicable) was administered.
Anthracycline-based regimens such as ACFV [doxorubicin
(DOX), cyclophosphamide (CPM), tegafur, and vincristine
(VCR)] were the front-line chemotherapies between 1980
and 1997, and taxane with or without anthracycline-based
regimens such as AT [DOX, docetaxel (DOC)] were frequently used since 1998. The ACFV regimen consisted of
DOX 40 mg/m2 i.v., CPM 500 mg/m2 i.v., and VCR
1.4 mg/m2 (maximum 2.0 mg/body) i.v. at day 1, and
repeated every 3 weeks, along with tegafur 800 mg/body
p.o. daily until white blood cell (WBC) counts dropped
below 2,000/mm3. When cumulative dose of DOX exceeded 400 mg/m2, regimen was switched to CMF (CPM,
methotrexate, fluorouracil) for maximum of 2 years in CR
cases, or until disease progression was observed or sideeffects became intolerable in non-CR cases. AT regimen
included DOX 50 mg/m2 i.v. and DOC 60 mg/m2 i.v. at
day 1 followed by every 3-week administration of the
combination. DOX was discontinued after total dose of
DOX exceeded 400 mg/m2 and changed to a regimen
mainly with DOC, similar to that described for ACFV.
Prior and during the treatment, all patients underwent
evaluation with complete medical history, physical

Breast Cancer (2012) 19:218–237

examination, baseline blood tests, and imaging evaluations
[radiography, bone scintigraphy, computed tomography
scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasonography, if necessary and available]. Effects of the treatment
were generally monitored by imaging analyses at every
3 months for lesions detected at diagnosis of OMBC or every
6 months without detectable lesions before the treatment.
Effects of the treatment were assessed by analyses of
maximum response, according to either the criteria of the
World Health Organization (WHO) [19] or the Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0
[20] since its announcement in 2004. Responses in bone
metastases were evaluated using the methods reported by
MDACC [14, 15], with CR as clear evidence of complete
bone recalcification with attainment of near-normal bone
architecture or normalization of scan, and PR as radiological evidence of sclerosis in lytic lesions or marked
improvement of bone scan. In recent years, MRI was
performed when available, and the imaging information
was taken into account in evaluation of bone metastases.
Responses in pleural fluids were determined as: CR for
radiological demonstration of complete disappearance of
pleural fluid, and PR for 50% or more decrease. For study
inclusion, pathological diagnosis of the primary lesions had
to be obtained, whereas tissue or cellular pathology of the
metastatic lesions was preferred but not mandatory.
Variables
Information regarding patient age, DFI, PS, involved organs
and their number, status of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), and HER2, Ki67 status, and previous
treatments prior to the present study periods was obtained
from medical records. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining
was performed for ER, PgR, HER2, and Ki67. ER and PgR
positivity were defined as any positive nuclear staining
(C1%), and HER2 positivity was defined as IHC score 3? or
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with amplification
ratio C2.0. The cutoff point for Ki67 index was set as
13.25%, with below 14% defined as low, and 14% or higher
defined as high expression [21]. Intrinsic breast cancer subtypes were classified according to a gene expression profilevalidated IHC surrogate panel [22] as follows: luminal A
(ER positive, low Ki67, and HER2 negative), luminal B (ER
positive, high Ki67, and HER2 negative), HER2-like (any
ER, any Ki67, and HER2 positive), and basal-like (ER
negative, any Ki67, and HER2 negative).
Statistical analyses
The characteristics of the patients with assessable data
were compared with v2 test or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests.
Overall survival (OS) was defined as duration from

221

initiation of treatment to last visit or death. Progressionfree interval (PFI) was defined as duration from initiation
of treatment to the point when disease progression was
detected. Complete response (CR) achieved by a systemic
therapy or no evidence of clinical disease (NED) after a
local therapy was considered relapse-free, and the duration
between induction of relapse-free status and the point of
relapse detection was defined as the relapse-free interval
(RFI); survival time after induction of relapse-free status
without relapse was defined as relapse-free survival (RFS).
Unrelated death other than from breast cancer was considered as censored in evaluation of PFI and RFI. Survival
curves were determined by the Kaplan–Meier method, and
analyzed using the log-rank test. A multivariate analysis
was performed by Cox regression and included the following variables: age, DFI, PS, number of involved organs,
types of involved organs, liver metastasis, hormone
receptor status, HER2 status, Ki67 status, intrinsic subtype,
administration of local therapy, and chemotherapy regimens. Differences were considered statistically significant
for P \ 0.05. All P values were calculated for two-sided
analyses.

Results

30 years
Patient characteristics
There were 75 OMBC cases with sufficient records, and the
patient characteristics at diagnosis are presented in
Table 1. Performance status was good (PS 0 or 1) in the
majority of subjects (92%). The number of organs involved
with metastatic lesions was 1 in 44 cases (59%) and 2 in 31
cases (41%). Visceral metastases were found in approximately half of cases (48%). Metastases in liver, known as
the worst prognosis group, were found in 10 patients. No
brain metastasis was found at time of OMBC diagnosis.
Ki67 levels were low in 42 cases (56%) and high in 18
cases (24%), though we encountered more cases with
negative Ki67 staining by IHC in cases whose samples
were preserved for prolonged periods from their acquisition. Intrinsic subtypes were luminal A in 26 cases (35%),
luminal B in 7 cases (9%), HER2-like in 13 cases (17%),
and basal-like in 18 cases (24%). Adjuvant or neoadjuvant
therapy prior to relapse detection was performed in 30
cases (40%), which include anthracycline and/or taxanebased regimens in 16 cases (21%) and non-anthracycline
and/or taxane-based regimens (CMF, fluorouracil, mitomycin C) in 14 cases (19%). For the metastatic lesions, 3
patients (4%) received chemotherapy prior to the present

study periods, whereas no systemic treatments were previously performed in other 65 cases (87%).
Treatments administered
Systemic chemotherapy was performed as an initial treatment for OMBC in 66 cases (88%), including 63 cases
(83%) with chemotherapy only and 3 cases (4%) with
simultaneous treatment of both chemo- and radiation
therapy, as an initial treatment. Others at first received
local treatment by either radiation therapy (5 cases, 7%) or
surgical excision (4 cases, 5%), followed by a systemic
treatment. Chemotherapy regimens utilized in the study
subjects included anthracycline-based regimens in 23 cases
(30.7%), taxane with or without anthracycline-based regimens in 49 cases (65.3%), and molecular-targeted regimens in 3 cases (4.0%). Among the anthracycline-based
regimens, ACFV regimen was most frequently used (15
cases). Among the taxane with or without anthracyclinebased regimens, AT regimen was the most common (40
cases). In 23 cases administered anthracycline-based regimens against OMBC, adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to relapse was performed in 4 cases (17.4%);
regimens included non-anthracycline and/or taxane-based
regimens (CMF, fluorouracil, mitomycin C) in 3 cases
(13.0%) and anthracycline and/or taxane-based regimens in
1 case (4.3%). Among 49 cases who received taxane with
or without anthracycline-based regimens for OMBC, 23
cases (46.9%) received adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy, including non-anthracycline and/or taxane-based
regimens (9 cases, 18.4%) and anthracycline and/or taxanebased regimens (14 cases, 28.6%). Patients whose OMBC
was treated with taxane with or without anthracyclinebased regimens had more frequently received adjuvant/
neoadjuvant therapy for their primary lesions, compared
with those whose OMBC had been treated with anthracycline-based regimens. Among those who had received
adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapies to their primary lesions,

Breast Cancer (2012) 19:218–237

agents with more potent antitumor effects were more frequently used in those whose treatment for OMBC was
taxane-based compared with those with anthracyclinebased regimens.
Response to systemic or multidisciplinary treatments
in each subgroup
Table 2 presents overall responses in all 75 subjects treated
either by systemic therapy only (chemotherapies except 1
case with hormone therapy) or by multidisciplinary treatment in combination with local therapies. In 68 cases for
which isolated effects of systemic therapy only were evaluated, overall response rates (ORR: CR ? PR) were 65 cases
[95.6%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 86.8–98.9%], with CR
in 33 cases (48.5%, 95% CI 36.4–60.9%) and PR in 32 cases
(47.1%, 95% CI 35.0–59.5%). The overall effects of multidisciplinary treatments were evaluated in all the OMBC
cases (N = 75), with CR or NED (CR/NED), and PR
achieved in 48 cases (64.0%, 95% CI 52.0–74.5%), and 23
cases (30.7%, 95% CI 20.8–42.5%), respectively, with ORR
(CR/NED ? PR) of 71 cases (94.7%, 95% CI 86.2–98.3%).
When CR or CR/NED rates were compared in each subgroup, those with only one organ involved with metastatic
lesions showed significantly higher CR or CR/NED rates
compared with those with 2 involved organs, in either systemic therapy only groups (P = 0.047) or those who
received multidisciplinary treatments (P = 0.002). Among
metastatic patients with single organ involvement, CR was
achieved in 60.5% of patients treated with systemic therapy
and in 79.5% of those who received multidisciplinary
treatments. Patients with low Ki67 levels tended to show
higher CR or CR/NED rates with either systemic
(P = 0.055) or multidisciplinary treatments (P = 0.09).
Among patients who received any local therapy, those whose
approaches were multidisciplinary demonstrated higher CR/
NED rates (P = 0.003) than those treated with chemotherapy as solo treatment. CR or CR/NED rates were higher in
patients who received anthracycline-based regimens for
their OMBC (P = 0.010 in systemic therapy only,
P = 0.064 in multidisciplinary treatment group) compared
with those who received taxane with or without anthracycline-based regimens. Other factors such as patient age, DFI,
status of hormone receptors and HER2, intrinsic subtype, and
presence of liver metastases did not significantly affect rates
for CR or CR/NED.
Overall survival (OS), progression-free interval (PFI),
and relapse-free interval (RFI)
Median follow-up duration was 103 (6–329) months. Figure 1 shows OS, PFI, and RFI estimated by the Kaplan–Meier
method for all study subjects. The RFI curve starts with all the

223

patients who have achieved CCR/NED after multidisciplinary therapy (N = 75, 64% of all the study subjects), and the
RFI is shown as percentage of the patients remained CCR/
NED in the total study subjects. The estimated medians were
OS of 185.0 months, PFI of 68.5 months, and RFI of
48.0 months. The estimated overall survival rate (OSR) was
79.2% at 5 years (95% CI 69.6–90.0%, 45 cases), 59.2% at
10 years (95% CI 46.9–74.7%, 16 cases), 51.2% at 15 years
(95% CI 37.6–69.7%, 10 cases), and 34.1% at 20 years (95%
CI 19.6–59.5%, 4 cases); the progression-free rate (PFR) was
56.8% at 5 years (95% CI 46.0–70.2%, 37 cases), 32.8% at
10 years (95% CI 22.3–48.1%, 10 cases), and 29.1% at
15 years and 20 years (95% CI 18.6–45.6%; 15 years: 6
cases; 20 years: 3 cases); the relapse-free rate (RFR) was
45.0% at 5 years (95% CI: 34.6-58.6%, 27 cases), and 27.4%
at 10, 15, and 20 years (95% CI: 17.9-42.0%; 10 years: 8
cases; 15 years: 4 cases; 20 years: 3 cases). Among those
whose PFR or RFR was longer than 128.0 and 101.0 months,
respectively, no case with disease progression was observed.
Median OS in cases with single organ involvement with
metastatic lesions was 292 months with OSR of 73% at
10 years and 52% at 20 years, median RFI was 95 months,
and RFR was 42% at 10 and 20 years, representing the best
prognostic subgroup. Patients who received local therapy
also showed good prognosis, with OSR of 82% at 10 years
and 53% at 20 years, and RFR of 38% at 10 years and
20 years. OS in this subgroup had not reached median. By the
time the current analyses were finalized, there were 3 cases
(4%) that met our definition of clinical cure, and those subjects remained clinically relapse free for their entire survival
periods, dying of traumatic intracranial hemorrhage at 85
years old, presumed acute cardiovascular disease at 64 years
old, and an accident at 47 years old.
OS in various response groups is shown in Fig. 2. In cases
where CR/NED was induced, OS was significantly longer
than in those who achieved PR or stable disease (SD)
(P \ 0.0001). Estimated median OS in CR/NED cases was
192.2 months, with 60-month OSR of 92.4% (95% CI 84.5–
100%), 120-month OSR of 79.6% (95% CI 67.0–94.6%),
180-month OSR of 68.9% (95% CI 52.8–89.8%), and
240-month OSR of 45.9% (95% CI 27.0–78.2%); approximately 80% and 70% of CR/NED cases survived for 10 and
15 years, respectively, and about half of those cases were
anticipated to survive 20 years after initial diagnosis of
OMBC.
Results of univariate analysis of OS, PFI, and RFI are
shown in Table 3 by each factor. Factors that showed statistically significant benefits on OS were: single organ
involvement by metastatic lesions (P = 0.0063), receipt of
local therapies (P = 0.0063), absence of metastasis in liver
(P = 0.0025), and anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens (P = 0.0245). Statistically favorable factors for PFI
were the same as those for OS except chemotherapy regimes,

demonstrated more favorable effects on OS, though the
difference did not reach statistical significance
(P = 0.097). Single organ involvement with metastatic
lesions showed statistically significant benefit on PFI
(P = 0.0023). Shorter DFI (P = 0.042), single organ
involvement with metastatic lesions (P = 0.030), and
administration of a local therapy (P = 0.039) showed
significantly better effects on RFI, whereas negative hormone receptors (P = 0.086) and low Ki67 levels
(P = 0.070) showed preferable trends toward better RFI
despite lack of statistical significance.

Review of literature on OMBC
Current status of MBC outcomes
At present, MBC is generally incurable. Despite ample
reports on therapeutic outcomes of MBC, results from
observation for over 10 years are rare, and therefore little is
known regarding OS and RFR (CR/NED maintenance rate)
in order to assess the possibility of achieving clinical cure
in MBC. We summarize findings from publications to date
on prognosis of MBC based on long-term observations in
Table 5. Though such publications are extremely limited,
OS for MBC has been reported as 12.2–22.5% at 5 years,
3.8–5.3% at 10 years, or 2.7% at 15 years. Long-term RFR
(CR/NED maintenance rate), which one could consider as
near clinical cure, has been reported as 3.1–3.2% at
5 years, 1.9–3.4% for over 10 years, or 2–5% in general
[3]. Furthermore, subpopulation of MBC who have
achieved CR by chemotherapy could remain CR for over
20 years [6, 14, 23].
Reports by Greenberg and Rahman et al. from MDACC
were the first to describe long-term prognosis of MBC with
sustained CR and have refined a standard for current
understanding on long-term outcome in MBC treated with
chemotherapy [6, 15]. More recently, Güth et al. [11]
reported results from a nonselective population-based
cohort study on long-term prognosis and their characteristics in MBC. In their study, 5 out of 149 MBC patients
(3.4%) remained with no clinical evidence of cancer
relapse for 9–14 years. Their results were encouraging,
suggesting that, though not many, a few MBC cases do
survive for prolonged periods or even potentially achieve
clinical cure, although the absolute necessity for including
chemotherapy in treating every MBC patients was not fully
supported in this particular study, since 4 out of 5 of those
long-term survivors in that study had not received chemotherapy. The commentary on this article by Babiera
et al. [24] also stressed that we must continue to learn not

only from those who have succumbed to the disease but
also from those who succeeded in escaping from their fate
with MBC.
Theories supporting multidisciplinary approach
for OMBC and the Swenerton Score
Revolution in understanding of breast cancer biology,
natural history, therapeutic approaches, and evaluation of
prognostic factors has modified our strategy for breast
cancer treatment, either de novo or metastatic, and drastically improved survival. There have been three major
paradigms for biology of breast cancer. First, in 1894, the
Halsted theory defined breast cancer as a local disease that
spreads in an orderly fashion and eventually becomes
systemic, therefore proposing radical mastectomy as
essential to cure the disease [25, 26]. The second paradigm,
proposed by Fisher et al. in 1980, on the other hand, considered overt breast cancer as a systemic disease even at
inception, therefore suggesting that therapies targeting
local or regional lesions would not affect survival [27]. As
the Fisher theory became more widely accepted than that of
Halsted, importance of systemic therapies was underscored, and such treatments have been increasingly
applied. However, subsequent evidence demonstrated that
control over local lesions might also affect patient outcomes in MBC. Based on the two ostensibly contradictory
theories and cumulative evidence, a third paradigm was
proposed by Hellman et al. in 1994 [28], integrating the
two previous hypotheses. The Hellman theory, also known
as a spectrum paradigm, hypothesizes that breast cancer
comprises a biological spectrum extending from purely
localized to systemic nature, but also including many
intermediate stages from the point of their first detection.
Subsequently, in 1995, Hellman proposed another theory, describing a novel concept, OMBC, as a characteristic
subset of MBC [16]. In principle, the new theory presumes
that likelihood of metastasis, as well as the number of
involved organs and the location of the metastases, reflect
the nature of the tumor. It also reiterates the importance of
local therapy, either with or without combination of systemic therapies in metastatic or relapsing breast cancer to
achieve better prognosis. Patients with oligometastases,
either de novo or following systemic treatment, should
reflect their relatively ‘‘local’’ state of the tumor and
therefore ablation could cure these lesions, whereas more
advanced, i.e., systemic in nature, disease would require
more aggressive and effective systemic approach. Newer
surgical or radiation therapies may further be required for
curative treatment of such oligometastases.
Similarly, three major hypotheses on tumor cell kinetics
have been proposed. The oldest is the Skipper–Schabel–
Wilcox model (Log-kill model) reported in 1964. In this

model, the authors hypothesized, using the L1210 leukemia cell lines, that tumor cell doubling time is constant
regardless of cancer size, and therefore a set dosage of
chemotherapeutic agent should kill tumor cells at a constant ratio [29]. According to this hypothesis, antitumor
agents have to be administered up to the maximally tolerable levels, or treatments ought to be started while tumor
cell mass is small enough for the host to tolerate an amount
of antitumor agent necessary to effectively eliminate entire
tumor cell populations. Subsequently, the Godie–Coldman
hypothesis was proposed in 1979. In this hypothesis,
authors noted a possibility for sudden spontaneous mutation that renders initially drug-sensitive tumor cells, which
presumably account for the majority of the tumor mass in
micrometastases, as drug-resistant after several cell cycles;
therefore, delay in systemic therapy could result in a major
disadvantage to patient survival [30]. The third hypothesis
by Norton and Simon considers, in human breast cancers,
that tumor cell proliferation follows a Gompertzian phenomenon and decelerates, while reaching a ‘‘plateau
phase’’ as the tumor enlarges. Consequently, fast-growing,
smaller tumors regress more rapidly in response to an

antitumor agent compared with larger tumors, but also
regrow faster (the Norton–Simon hypothesis) [31]. Plausibility of this hypothesis was demonstrated in a study with
paclitaxel dose-dense therapy. Though efficacy and validity
of those three hypotheses have not been proven in every
tumor type or for all chemotherapy regimens, it appears to
be commonly recognized that antitumor agents exert more
efficient regression in smaller tumors than in those that
have larger growth fraction and shorter doubling time.
The ‘‘small is sensitive’’ concept was supported by data
of a study on MBC treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy by
Swenerton et al. [14]. In this study, authors evaluated
influences of estimated quantitative tumor burden, instead
of number of organs involved, in combination with other
characteristics of the host, tumor, and therapeutic approaches, and assessed predictive and prognostic factors for
responses to chemotherapy and consequent survival in 619
MBC cases treated with FAC regimen (5-fluorouracil,
adriamycin, and cyclophosphamide) or its modified version. The extent of metastatic lesions was evaluated by
prospective review of the data from radiological images
and clinical records using a scoring system [Swenerton
Score (SS)]. The following 12 anatomical sites were considered: ipsilateral breast, contralateral breast, lymph
nodes, skin/chest wall, lungs, pleura, liver, mediastinum,
abdominal and pelvic cavities, bones, bone marrow, and
central nervous system. A value was assigned to describe
the extent of disease at each site as follows: 0 = no disease, 1 = strong suspicion of involvement but insufficient
laboratory or clinical information to define further,
2 = minimal involvement, 5 = moderate involvement,
and up to 10 as extensive involvement. The total burden of
metastatic disease was the sum of the scores for all known
disease sites. Both responses (P = 0.01) and survival
(P \ 0.01) showed highly significant correlations with the
evaluation of total tumor burden by this scoring system.
Not only was the overall response rate (ORR) clearly
related to the estimated tumor burden, but the association
was even more marked in cases that achieved CR. Patients
with smaller tumor burden (SS \5) achieved CR in 38%,
whereas the CR rate in those with larger tumor loads (SS
[20) was only 7%. The difference in survival distributions
among the various response categories was statistically
significant (P \ 0.01). Patients achieving CR had a definite
survival advantage over patients in PR (P = 0.04). These
findings suggest that the Swenerton Score is a more sensitive measurement of tumor burden than those using the
number of sites with metastatic lesions as a parameter.
Swenerton’s study sends a critical message that early
diagnosis and timely institution of combination chemotherapy for MBC, while the relative tumor burden is low,
could be key to achieving best possible outcome. However,
the Swenerton Score is not practical for clinical application

229

due to the huge efforts required in its calculation, and
therefore it is rarely utilized. As another independent predictive factor that reflects tumor burden, circulating tumor
cell (CTC) numbers are being evaluated. Cristofanilli et al.
suggested that CTC numbers have superior and independent prognostic value for tumor burden. However, this
study did not evaluate CTC numbers as a predictive factor
for efficacy of thermotherapy in MBC [32].
As discussed above, the spectrum paradigm and concept
of oligometastases proposed by Hellman are ratified both
by the logical hypotheses for tumor cell kinetics and by
results from the Swenerton Score study. At individual
cellular levels, each breast cancer encompasses a spectrum
of local and systemic natures, and as the disease progresses, the systemic nature of the cancer dominates. Since
clinical observations also indicate that smaller tumors are
more susceptible to chemotherapy, multidisciplinary
approach with early and aggressive systemic therapy
combined with local treatment to OMBC should be considered as front-line treatment, particularly in those who
show sufficient response to initial systemic therapies, to
achieve greatest therapeutic benefits.
Reports on therapeutic outcomes of OMBC
Reports on therapeutic outcomes of OMBC are limited, the
majority focusing on local treatment rather than curative
attempt with multidisciplinary treatments. Table 6 presents
a summary of such limited studies that intended cure of
MBC, by multidisciplinary approaches utilizing systemic
and/or local treatments. Among those studies, 4 (Boner,
Blumenshein, Nieto, Hanrahan) initially performed local
therapy targeting the tumor, followed by adjuvant-type
therapy after induction of stage IV-NED. This approach
emphasizes the relatively local nature of OMBC.
Borner et al. [33] report data from the only randomized
controlled trial (RCT) to date with patients of OMBC. In
OMBC patients who developed isolated locoregional
recurrence after mastectomy, absence of remote metastases
was verified and locoregional lesions were surgically
excised after irradiation to induce stage IV-NED, macroscopically determined as total removal of the recurrent
lesions. Subjects were then randomly allocated either to
receive an adjuvant-type therapy with tamoxifen (TAM) or
not. Analyses of the follow-up data indicated that, in hormone-sensitive subjects, systemic administration of TAM
significantly suppressed progression of the disease.
Blumenschein et al. [34] described outcomes for 59
OMBC cases with remote metastasis and/or relapse.
Recurring lesions that are easily resectable, such as locoregional recurrence or metastases in the lung or liver, were
first surgically removed to achieve stage IV-NED, followed by chemotherapy and, if applicable, radiation

therapy to the site of relapse. The results from this study
suggested a desirable outcome and potential cure with
multidisciplinary treatment group in OMBC as a small
subset of MBC, and that early diagnosis for MBC is of
benefit.
Nieto et al. reported outcome of selected 60 OMBC
cases treated with multidisciplinary treatments combining a
local therapy and high-dose chemotherapy with autologous
hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HDC). Subjects in
this study were limited to those who met at least one of the
following criteria: metastatic lesion was surgically
removable prior to HDC or was within a single irradiation
field of curative intent, and bone marrow tumor cell infiltration was less than 5% by microscopic evaluations. Cases
with liver or brain metastases, those that received chemotherapy for their metastatic lesions prior to the present
study periods, or relapse within a previous irradiation field
were excluded. Median observation period was 62 months.
Median OS and 5-year OSR were 80 months and 62%, and
median RFS and 5-year RFS rates were 52 months and
52%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that cases
that involved single organ had significantly better RFS
(P = 0.03) compared with those whose metastatic lesions
involved 2 or 3 organs. These results for long-term prognosis of OMBC are encouraging and imply a possibility to
re-evaluate the current tenet, if larger-scale prospective
randomized studies validate their findings, that early
detection of relapsing cancer is of no benefit.
In an editorial comment to the article by Nieto et al., the
editor Hortobagyi introduced data from a clinical trial
evaluating efficacy of adjuvant-type systemic therapy following local therapy on OMBC since 1974 at MDACC, to
which the editor belongs. Taken together with data of the
Nieto study, Hortobagyi suggested that 3–30% of selected
MBC patients with distant metastases and those who
achieve long-term disease-free status by multidisciplinary
treatments are probably curable [4]. Subjects in the study
by Nieto et al. indeed represent a subgroup of patients
whose outcome would be affected by choice of therapeutic
approach. Patients who are asymptomatic and hormone
receptor positive are those expected to have most favorable
prognosis, and therefore, according to the currently most
common practice standard, are likely to initially receive
palliative hormonal therapy. In contrast, data from the
Nieto study suggest that this subgroup of patients would
rather most benefit from more intensive, multidisciplinary
approach. The editorial comment therefore emphasized the
importance of large-scale controlled clinical trials to verify
the hypothesis and also reiterates Nieto’s conclusion suggesting that an intensive monitoring strategy to detect
relapsing lesions after mastectomy is essential.
Hanrahan et al. summarized their 30-year experience of isolated recurrence cases with 4 phase II trials at



 In this study, the subjects first received local
therapy (surgery and/or radiotherapy) with curative intent,
and efficacy of adjuvant-type chemotherapy in subjects
who achieved stage IV-NED was evaluated. Doxorubicinbased regimens as adjuvant-type chemotherapy were performed in 259 out of 285 cases. Median observation periods until surviving subjects’ last visits were 212.5 months.
Median OS time was 87 months with OSR of 56, 42, and
26% at 5, 10, and 20 years, respectively, and median RFS
time of 42 months with RFS rates of 41, 34, and 26% at 5,
10, and 20 years, respectively. There were 28 patients
(10.8%) who remained disease free for more than 20 years.
Despite several historical biases, this is the study to date
with largest scale and longest observation period, in which
effects of adjuvant-type chemotherapy in OMBC patients
who achieved stage IV-NED by a local therapy were
evaluated. Authors also performed comparative analyses
with archival control patients treated only with local therapy at their institution and found that patients who received
an adjuvant-type chemotherapy after the induction of
stage IV-NED showed higher OS and RFS rates. At
present, data based on a phase III randomized control trial
evaluating efficacy of adjuvant-type chemotherapy in
stage IV-NED breast cancer patients are not yet available.
Nonetheless, the result from MDACC clearly suggests an
importance of adjuvant-type chemotherapy in managing
stage IV breast cancer patients.
A report in the Cochrane Library summarized current
understanding on efficacy of systemic treatments against
locoregional recurrence in stage IV-NED breast cancer
cases after receiving curative local treatment. Unfortunately, 3 out of the 4 RCTs included in that comprehensive analysis, other than the previously mentioned Borner
study, were of small scale with sample sizes less than 20,
and therefore the review had to conclude that evidence
supporting efficacy of systemic therapy following local
therapy against locoregional recurrence is insufficient.
Rahman et al. also reported long-term outcome of the
same patient group that Greenberg et al. had reported. The analyses did not solely focus on OMBC or multidisciplinary approach with local therapy of curative
intent. Nevertheless, the study warrants mention as it
addresses many aspects that we intend to stress in this
review article, as: it was a rare report that included
cases presumed as OMBC, it was a clinical trial that
utilized systemic chemotherapy as an initial treatment for
relapsing tumor, outcomes for up to 5 years were
shown despite lacking details of local treatments, and it
showed that patients with less organ involvement with
metastatic lesions and with lower Swenerton Score demonstrated better CR rates, as well as 5-year OS and PFS,
indicating that OMBC with lower tumor burden represents
a subgroup with relatively good prognosis.



Breast Cancer

We believe that the present assessment of experience
with OMBC patients in our institution for the past 30 years
is the first to consider OMBC as a systemic disease and to
describe corresponding outcomes in response to multidisciplinary strategy, first with systemic chemotherapy, followed by local therapy in a selected subject population who
responded to the initial systemic treatments.
Comparison of the data from various studies is challenging, as criteria for subject selection and specific therapeutic approaches are not identical. Nonetheless, overall
prognosis for OMBC are OSR of 56–87, 35–73, and
26–25%, and RFR of 22–63, 27–42, and 26–42%, at 5, 10,
and 20 years, respectively, though reports on outcome over
10 years are very limited (Table 6). These data suggest
that, though still challenging, prognosis for patients with
OMBC is more promising than that for patients with MBC
in total (see Table 5 and discussion in the previous
section).
Benefits of local and systemic treatment for OMBC
At present, it is not fully understood how or when to
integrate such local management into standard systemic
therapies for MBC or which subpopulations of patients
would most benefit from such treatments. Local therapy,
other than as a palliative means, is not generally recommended for early-stage MBC patients in current clinical
practice. However, such approach may be worth consideration in a limited population of OMBC that demonstrates
good response to systemic therapy. No data from
RCT assessing efficacy of local therapy for OMBC are
currently available. Discussion regarding outcomes of
metastatic lesions in various organs can be found in other
articles of this Special Feature. Unfortunately, reports on
OMBC outcomes treated with local therapy are oftentimes
biased by various factors such as patient selection or
leading times. Based on results from nonrandomized
comparative studies on local therapy or observational
studies in patients who received local therapies, overall
outcome for OMBC appears promising, though some
investigators argue that these results showing preferable
outcomes might be incorrect due to patient selection biases. In addition, difference in tumoricidal effects of systemic and local therapy is of consideration. Chemotherapy
could effectively eliminate cancer cells in a tumor burden
of \1 million cells, whereas surgical debulking procedure
can easily remove a focus of cancer up to an estimated 50
billion cells. Every 7 Gy irradiation would kill approximately 1 logarithm cells in radiosensitive tumors, i.e.,
56 Gy irradiation eliminating every cancer cell in a
metastasis with 100 million cells. On the other hand,
therapies targeting local lesions are not effective in eliminating cancer cells that could be systemically spread but

Breast Cancer

might be subclinical. Therefore, we should carefully
examine characteristics of each therapeutic approach, and
data from prospective studies on optimal combination of
systemic and local therapies should be collected to establish therapeutic strategy that is maximally tumoricidal.
Recent advances in research on cancer stem cell (CSC)
biology have revealed possible mechanisms by which CSC
could affect therapeutic efficacy. Biological characteristics
of CSCs may be distinct in either primary or metastatic
lesions or in circulation. CSCs in a metastatic lesion may
differentiate to tumor cells, which may cause a second
metastasis via circulation. These possibilities also stress the
importance of locally targeting CSCs.
Interestingly, 30–40% of clinically diagnosed OMBC
patients treated first with local therapies and achieving
stage IV-NED demonstrate widespread metastases within
3 months after the local therapy, and eventually, 50–80%
progress to MBC within 2 years. These observations indicate that the subpopulation of patients diagnosed as OMBC
could actually have other lesions that are not clinically
detectable but equivalent rather to MBC, which cannot be
controlled with local treatment only. As a result, overall
5-year OS rates in OMBC are 4–36%. The largest study
so far on outcomes of stage IV-NED OMBC patients,
conducted at MDACC as mentioned earlier in our assessment of the previously published study results, was not a
RCT. Hortobagyi, a lead investigator of this study, ponders
that, considering the extremely high incidence of additional
metastases when treated with regional treatment only,
control arm was not ethically acceptable. RCTs on
efficacy of systemic treatment in stage IV-NED patients to
date are also only small scale and have not sufficiently
proven the benefit of systemic approach. Accurate
selection of ‘‘pure’’ OMBC by newer diagnostic means and
yet-to-be identified markers would allow us to determine
exact efficacy and plausibility of these two approaches,
either solo or in combination. Whether local or systemic
therapy should be the first to be administered in treatment
of OMBC is another important aspect that has not been
clarified.
Guidelines for treatment of OMBC
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology, Breast Cancer
version 2 (2011) recommends to initially perform a local
therapy (surgical resection and/or radiation therapy), with
consideration of subsequent systemic therapies for locoregional recurrence (breast, chest wall, axillary, supraclavicular, and internal mammary node recurrence) [38].
Efficacy of chemotherapy following the local therapies on
isolated local and/or regional ipsilateral recurrence is being
evaluated prospectively by an international multicenter



The international guideline for management of MBC:
Can MBC be cured? by the European School of OncologyMetastatic Breast Cancer (ESO-MBC) Task Force, is
another important guideline, based on the discussion at the
European Breast Cancer Conference (EBCC)-6,]. In particular, the guidelines focus on
current understanding and therapeutic approaches for
OMBC with one or only a few organs involved with
metastatic lesions, since these form a distinctive subset of
MBC patients who are ‘‘potentially curable’’ and would
most benefit from multidisciplinary treatment. As shown in
the outline (Table 7), the guidelines conclude, ‘‘The presented data, overall, seem to suggest the possibility of a
curative multidisciplinary therapeutic approach for at least
a fraction of patients with limited MBC. Based on the
available data, the ESO-MBC Task Force retains its original recommendation statement (2007): A small but very
important subset of MBC patients, for example, those with
a solitary metastatic lesion, can achieve complete remission and a long-term survival. A more aggressive and
multidisciplinary approach should be considered for these
selected patients. A clinical trial addressing this specific
situation is needed’’.

Discussion
Cure for MBC is practically impossible to achieve with our
current therapeutic tactics. However, OMBC, a subgroup
of MBC, demonstrates relatively favorable prognosis. In
the present study, we analyzed outcomes of OMBC from
the 30-year experience of our own institution and other
study results reported in literature, intending to gain perspective on the possibility of clinical cure for MBC.
First, we aimed to attest whether prolonged relapse-free
condition (CR/NED maintenance) can be sufficiently
assumed as clinical cure of OMBC, by evaluating longterm outcome of OMBC patients in our institution. Onethird of the OMBC patients treated with multidisciplinary
approach in our institution were expected to survive over
20 years, and one-fourth of the entire subject population
analyzed were supposed to remain relapse free, based on
the estimated OS and CR/NED maintenance rates,
respectively. None of those who achieved CR/NED
developed progressive disease after 101 months. Patients
with a single organ involved with metastasis showed
markedly better prognosis. These data indicate, despite
various biases intrinsic to a retrospective analysis, that
OMBC represents a small but particular subgroup of MBC,
in which prolonged relapse-free interval/survival (CR/NED
maintenance) and subsequent clinical cure are not

Identification of MBC patients suitable for
curative treatment

Gene expression profiling may identify the highest probability of therapeutic benefit (potentially
leading to cure), and advances in pharmacogenetics may allow selection of the therapeutic
options with the higher therapeutic efficacy for the individual patient. Improved diagnostic tools
will improve the identification of truly solitary metastatic lesions susceptible to effective local
treatment.

Definition of cure and appropriate endpoints

‘‘Cure’’ does not necessarily mean destroying every cancer cell, but rather rendering the disease
harmless (without clinically significant adverse effects) for prolonged periods. Importantly, the
ultimate goal in MBC management is to prolong duration of life while maintaining good quality
of life. New endpoints must be defined to assess this global definition of cure.
An increasing number of randomized clinical trials document statistically significant
improvements in disease control with modern chemotherapy in MBC. In addition, a small but
recognizable subset of patients achieves long-term remission.

The role of systemic treatment

‘‘Adjuvant’’ systemic therapy after local
treatment

Available data suggest that, despite important differences in patient characteristics and selection
bias, at 5 years after local treatment for a locally recurrent or metastatic lesion followed by
adjuvant systemic treatment, 36–52% of patients remain alive and without evidence of relapse.
The utility of chemotherapy after locoregional treatment for isolated locoregional recurrence
(i.e., not associated with distant metastasis) is still an open question being currently investigated
in a joint study by the International Breast Cancer Study Group (IBSCG) and the National
Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP), under the umbrella of the Breast
International Group (BIG).

The role of local treatment

Available data demonstrate favorable results in a subset of patients undergoing ‘‘radical’’ local
therapy for metastatic disease. Selection bias and the retrospective nature of available data do
not allow for generalization of the results, and the use of such approaches must be
individualized.

Surgery for primary tumor in the presence
of metastatic disease

There is a bulk of retrospective data suggesting the importance of local treatment of primary
tumor and strongly recommending that well-conducted randomized trials be performed in this
setting. One such trial is being developed under the joint effort of Breast International Group
and the North American Intergroup. While waiting for data from these studies, surgery for
breast primary tumor can be considered as a relatively inexpensive and low-morbidity treatment
which can offer rapid local control and has potential for survival benefit, provided it is
performed optimally.

Surgery for lung metastases

The largest dataset comes from the International Registry of Lung Metastases and presents results
of lung metastasectomy in 467 breast cancer patients. Complete resection was possible in 84%
of patients and led to median survival of 37 months (5-year OS of 38%, 10-year OS of 22%).
Pulmonary resection in MBC patients, apart from its potential therapeutic value, is also an
important diagnostic tool, especially in patients with a suspected first recurrence. The
proportion of lesions proved not to be breast cancer metastases in various series ranges from 7%
to 66%.

Surgery for liver metastases

In various series of hepatic resection for breast cancer metastases, the reported median survival
ranged from 14.5 to 63 months and the 5-year survival from 14% to 61%, in general, comparing
well with nonsurgically treated patients. Most of the reported series, however, describe
extremely selected patients. Effective local control can be achieved by radiofrequency ablation
in solitary lesions less than 3 cm in diameter. This therapy provides promising survival rates in
patients with no visceral extrahepatic disease or with single bone metastases.

incidental but a plausible treatment goal by aggressive
application of neoadjuvant chemotherapy-type multidisciplinary treatment. The second aim of the present analysis
of OMBC outcomes in our institution is to elucidate possible factors that affect OMBC prognosis. We identified
such factors by multivariate analyses as single organ
involvement with metastatic lesions for both PFI and RFI,
and administration of local therapy and shorter DFI for
RFI. Anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimen for OS,
and negative hormone receptors and low Ki67 index for
RFI also showed trends for favorable prognosis though
lacked statistical significance. These data verify our
empirical understanding and rationale that single organ



involvement by metastatic lesions is a characteristic for a
MBC subgroup with favorable prognosis. Association of
shorter DFI with better OMBC prognosis may reflect faster
tumor cell proliferation that renders cells more susceptible
to chemotherapy. The present assessment encompasses
patients from over 30 years, when available choices of
agents for systemic therapy were also changing. Therefore,
patient outcomes cannot simply be compared. Nonetheless,
patients treated with anthracycline-based regimens for their
OMBC demonstrated better outcome than those treated
with taxane with or without anthracycline-based regimens.
We speculate that the former group of patients showed
greater sensitivity for chemotherapy after their relapse,


 they had less frequently received adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy for the primary lesions, and 
their regimen for adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy, if
received, was less potent, preserving remaining potential
for cancer cells to be targeted with a newly administered
tumoricidal agent. Relapse following more potent adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy might also reflect more malignant biology of cancer cells, which could be harder to
eliminate. Ironically, recent data suggest that adjuvant/
neoadjuvant chemotherapy for the primary lesion with
more potent antitumor effects would reduce efficacy of the
chemotherapy after relapses. Our data also
agreed with others suggesting that chemotherapy is more
effective on hormone receptor-negative than hormone
receptor-positive tumors. Ki67 is a marker for cellular
proliferative potential, and high Ki67 index has been
associated with greater sensitivity to chemotherapy ;
therefore, the present result was unexpected. We frequently experienced negative Ki67 staining in archived
tissue samples. The negative staining in preserved old
specimens is a limitation of the retrospective analysis and
may have underestimated the effect of Ki67 on OMBC
prognosis in our study. Dosage of chemotherapy agents we
used in the present study was relatively low compared with
those recommended by several more recent guidelines
(NCCN clinical practice guidelines). Therefore, we cannot
exclude a possibility that higher dose regimen might have
resulted in higher rate for cure. Though some studies
suggest dose-dependent increase of tumoricidal effects, others suggest that the most efficient antitumor effects
may not be observed at the highest possible dose.
As discussed above, biological heterogeneity of tumor
cells might limit the dose-responsiveness of antitumor
agents, which might be overcome by combination of
newer, non-cross-resistant agents. Thirdly, we performed a
systemic review of literature on the long-term outcome of
OMBC, in search of a clue to envision possible clinical
cure for MBC. As there are not many reports from studies
on OMBC prognosis, we included data from our own
institution in the systemic review. Comparison of the
results from different studies in literature is challenged by
various biases, such as differences in subjects’ background
and therapeutic choice in each clinical study. Among
those, lead-time bias needs particular attention. However,
if, as is generally recognized at present, early detection and
treatment of MBC do not prolong OS in MBC, lead-time
bias should be negligible. Nevertheless, overall outcome
for OMBC was markedly superior to those for the entire
MBC populations. These data strongly suggest that OMBC is a specific subgroup, in which clinical
cure is conceivable.
In the long-lasting battle against breast cancer, recent
advances in systemic and radiation therapies and



supportive means for unfavorable effects of these treatment, as well as novel diagnostic techniques for early
detection of metastatic or microinvasive lesions, are
immensely accelerating. Those advances would show best
and prompt benefit by targeting OMBC, rather than dealing
with the entire MBC population. When improved clinical
outcome is proven in OMBC, means of evaluation after
curative surgery for early breast cancer must be restructured to better identify this subgroup. Biomarkers that
determine biological characteristics for OMBC must be
identified to enable selection of the subgroup with better
prognosis, and provision of more appropriate treatment on
a molecular basis will improve the outcome in OMBC,
resulting in better prognosis of the entire MBC population.
Integration of findings in the above-mentioned various
areas will help us obtain better insights into treatments and
outcome of MBC.
As discussed in our evaluation of previous reports,
clinical cure is no longer beyond hope, at least in OMBC,
and 10 or even 20 years of long-term relapse-free survival/
interval (CR/NED maintenance rates) can be achieved at
relatively high incidence. Then, what level of proof for
clinical cure in OMBC or MBC would reasonably justify
curative intent in every breast cancer? In acute myeloid
leukemia (AML), a malignant tumor that we can currently
anticipate to achieve cure with a highest probability, longterm complete remission rates in adults are 20–30%, except
for acute promyelocytic leukemia whose prognosis is
exceptionally good [47–49]. These numbers appear similar
to those we observed for RFSI in patients with OMBC.
However, even in an era when cytosine arabinoside and
daunorubicin, core agents in the current chemotherapy
regimens, brought hope for cure of AML (1968–1974),
renowned hematologists such as Crosby or Boggs were
skeptical about aggressive chemotherapy and suggested
that supportive and/or palliative treatments without performing chemotherapies would be sufficient [50–52], with
their famous statement: ‘‘With the therapeutic agents that
we have today, there is no hope for cure and an idea that
cure is just around the corner is simply an optimistic illusion’’. Current advances in treatment of AML clearly
show that history has answered the question of whether or
not intensive approaches including chemotherapy should
be pursued to achieve cure. This historical evidence also
indicates that it is improbable that we will find a correct
answer while in the midst of controversy.
Cumulative, though limited, data on long-term prognosis in OMBC discussed herein clearly shed light on possible clinical cure in MBC, which we consider, to date, to
be deemed fatal. As Dr. Wood commented at the ‘‘Can
metastatic breast cancer be cured?’’ session in EBCC-6,
April 2008 in Berlin, physicians and patients should set
their mutual goal to achieve cure in treating breast cancer.


If a physician in charge considers a cure as out of scope,
sufficiently aggressive treatment that would potentially
cure the disease would never be chosen, despite patient’s
desire for a cure-oriented therapy, neglecting a possibility
to achieve clinical cure. Therefore, in order to accumulate
sufficient information to estimate outcomes and factors that
determine the outcomes in MBC, it is essential, for both
physicians and the patients with OMBC, to discuss their
pros and cons and to make a best suitable choice from
available therapeutic options. These options should take
multidisciplinary approaches, and even rather aggressive
ones that may not be highly provable to date to achieve
clinical cure should not be overly discouraged.

Conclusions
The long-term outcome of OMBC in our institution for
over 30 years was OSR of 59.2% at 10 years and 34.1% at
20 years, and RFR of 27.4% at 10 and 20 years. Those
whose metastatic lesions involved only one organ represented a subgroup with excellent prognosis (OSR of 73% at
10 years and 52% at 20 years, RFR of 42% at 10 and
20 years). There were 3 cases (4%) that we consider clinical cure, and more cases should be observed in the future.
We also reviewed literature on OMBC outcomes and found
that OSR is 35–73% at 10 years and 26–52% at 20 years,
and RFR is 27–42% at 10 years and 26–42% at 20 years.
Though more information should be compiled, current data
indicate that long-term prognosis in OMBC is distinct from
that in the entire population of MBC, in which relapse-free
survival rate (RFS rate) for 10–20 years is as low as
1.9–3.4% or 2–5%. As we assemble more data by longterm observations of multicenter prospective studies and
from results of phase II and III trials, we anticipate confirmation of long-term prognosis for OMBC and verification of factors that affect prognosis, enabling identification
of subgroups in MBC and to provide personalized and
multidisciplinary care, leading to improved overall prognosis for MBC. To accomplish this impending task,
cooperative efforts beyond a single institution and an
individual physician’s lifetime career are imperative.
