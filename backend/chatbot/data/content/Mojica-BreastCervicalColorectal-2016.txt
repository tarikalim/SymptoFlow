Overview

    Context & Rationale:
        Breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers account for 24% of all U.S. cancers.
        U.S. Latinas are disproportionately diagnosed at advanced stages compared with non-Hispanic White women.
        In Texas, advanced-stage diagnoses are particularly high (40% for breast, 36% for cervical, and 54% for colorectal cancer).
        Early detection through screening significantly improves survival, yet screening rates among Latinas remain below national goals.
    Purpose:
        To evaluate a theory-based, community health worker (CHW) intervention designed to educate and navigate low‑income, rarely or never‑screened Latina women toward receiving appropriate cancer screening tests.

Intervention Design

    Theoretical Framework:
        The intervention was based on the Health Belief Model (HBM), which posits that behavior change depends on:
            Perceived Susceptibility: How vulnerable one feels to the disease.
            Perceived Severity: Beliefs about the seriousness of the disease.
            Perceived Benefits: Belief in the effectiveness of taking action (e.g., screening) to reduce risk.
            Perceived Barriers: Obstacles that may hinder screening (e.g., cost, transportation, language).
            Cues to Action: Triggers (reminder calls, community events) that prompt behavior change.
            Self-Efficacy: Confidence in one’s ability to take action.

    Community Health Workers (CHWs):
        Bilingual, bicultural CHWs delivered the intervention.
        They were trained intensively over a 2‑week period (with booster sessions and ongoing monthly meetings) on:
            Study protocols (survey administration, data collection)
            Cancer risk factors and screening guidelines for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers.
            Navigation support strategies to help participants overcome barriers.

    Educational Sessions:
        Conducted in small classroom settings at sites provided by community organizations.
        Utilized bilingual flip charts with visual (front) and narrative (back) components to explain:
            Anatomy and risk factors for each cancer.
            Recommended screening tests and guidelines (e.g., mammograms starting at age 50, annual Pap tests, stool blood tests for colorectal screening).
        Sessions lasted about 90 minutes and were delivered in either Spanish or English.
        Participants were encouraged to ask questions and share personal experiences.

    Navigation Support:
        CHWs assisted with:
            Providing lists of local clinics offering low‑ or no‑cost screening.
            Scheduling or rescheduling appointments.
            Making reminder and follow‑up calls.
            Informing participants about mobile screening units and upcoming community health events.
        This support helped to bridge gaps between community members and the healthcare system.

    Data Collection Tools & Procedures:
        Recruitment and surveys were facilitated using iPads with wireless Internet for on‑site data entry.
        For large groups, hard copies were used with later data entry.
        Surveys included sociodemographic items (age, income, education, language, insurance status) and a Knowledge, Attitudes, and Beliefs (KAB) survey related to cancer screening guidelines and early detection.
        Follow‑up KAB surveys were administered immediately after educational sessions.

Study Methods

    Study Design:
        A single‑arm, nonrandomized, pre‑post design was used.
    Participants:
        A total of 691 eligible Latina women were enrolled from January 2011 to July 2012.
        Eligibility criteria were based on age and screening history:
            Women aged 40–74 who had never had a mammogram or not had one in the past 2 years.
            Women aged 18–65 with no Pap test or not in the past 3 years.
            Women aged 50–75 who had never had a stool blood test or not in the past 2 years.
    Recruitment:
        Participants were recruited by CHWs from multiple community settings (churches, community centers, parent–teacher associations, health fairs, etc.) in the west and south sides of San Antonio, Texas.
        Recruitment efforts were supported by promotional materials (posters, flyers) distributed in high‑traffic areas.
    Evaluation & Analysis:
        Pre‑ and post‑intervention changes in cancer screening knowledge and beliefs were measured using McNemar’s test.
        Logistic regression was used to assess the association between educational session attendance and self‑reported receipt of cancer screening tests, adjusting for sociodemographic factors.

Results

    Participation:
        Out of 1,612 women approached, 691 were enrolled.
        Among these, 535 (77%) attended at least one educational session.

    Demographic Profile:
        Mean age was 46 years.
        Approximately 53% of participants were U.S.‑born, and many were from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.
        A significant proportion were uninsured and primarily Spanish‑speaking.

    Knowledge Gains:
        Significant improvements were observed from pre‑ to post‑test in:
            Breast Cancer: Knowledge of the appropriate starting age for mammograms improved (from 4.3% to 9.9% correct among eligible women).
            Cervical Cancer: A higher percentage correctly answered that Pap tests should be annual (72% to 80% correct).
            Colorectal Cancer: Knowledge of the starting age and frequency for stool blood tests improved dramatically (e.g., correct knowledge increased from 19% to 70% for starting at age 50+ and from 42% to 75% for annual testing).

    Attitudinal Shifts:
        Post-intervention, a greater proportion of women agreed that regular cancer checks lead to early detection and cure, and more disagreed with fatalistic beliefs about cancer.

    Screening Behavior:
        Overall, 25% of eligible participants reported receiving at least one screening test (mammogram, Pap test, or stool blood test) after the intervention.
        Logistic regression analysis showed that, after adjusting for sociodemographic variables, women who attended at least one educational session were significantly more likely to report receipt of a screening test (OR = 1.70; 95% CI: 1.03, 2.82).

    Process Outcomes:
        Among those not initially reached by telephone, many still attended sessions.
        Some participants were placed on waiting lists for screening services, highlighting system-level barriers such as funding constraints at local clinics.

Conclusions

    Effectiveness of CHW Interventions:
        The CHW-led education-plus‑navigation model was effective in improving cancer screening knowledge and positively influencing screening behaviors among low‑income Latinas.
        The intervention successfully addressed multiple barriers, including language, cultural, and system‑level challenges.
    Implications for Public Health Practice:
        The study underscores the potential of community-based interventions to enhance cancer prevention efforts in underserved populations.
        The results support the integration of CHWs in preventive health programs and highlight the importance of culturally tailored educational strategies.
    Policy & Future Directions:
        The findings are particularly relevant in light of recent health reforms (e.g., provisions under the Affordable Care Act) that support the use of non‑licensed providers like CHWs.
        Future research should consider controlled designs and explore long-term impacts on cancer incidence and mortality.
