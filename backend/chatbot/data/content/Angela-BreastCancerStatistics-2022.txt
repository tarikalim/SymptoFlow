### 1. Overview and Key Findings

- **Increasing Incidence:**  
  Breast cancer incidence in the United States has been rising slowly over the past four decades. In the most recent period (2010–2019), incidence increased by about 0.5% annually. This rise is driven largely by increases in localized-stage disease and hormone receptor–positive tumors.

- **Declining Mortality:**  
  In contrast to incidence, breast cancer mortality has been falling since its peak in 1989. Overall, death rates declined by 43% from 1989 to 2020, equating to approximately 460,000 fewer deaths. However, the pace of decline has slowed in recent years—from a 1.9% annual decrease during 2002–2011 to a 1.3% annual decrease from 2011 to 2020.

- **Survival and Lifetime Risk:**  
  About 1 in 8 U.S. women will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer during their lifetime, and 1 in 39 will die from it. Five-year relative survival rates are very high for early-stage disease (over 99% for stage I) but drop markedly with advancing stage (down to 29% for stage IV).

### 2. Data Sources and Methodology

- **Data Collection:**  
  The estimates come from comprehensive, population-based cancer registries including the National Cancer Institute’s SEER program, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Program of Cancer Registries, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR). Mortality data were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics.

- **Statistical Methods:**  
  Incidence and mortality rates were age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. standard population and reported per 100,000 women. Trends were analyzed using Joinpoint Regression to calculate annual percent changes, with adjustments made for reporting delays. The study also used data from the National Health Interview Survey and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System for screening prevalence.

### 3. Detailed Findings

#### Incidence and Case Estimates
- **New Cases:**  
  For 2022, the report estimates approximately 287,850 new cases of invasive breast cancer and 51,400 cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The majority of invasive cancers (83%) are diagnosed in women aged 50 years and older.
  
- **Age Distribution:**  
  The median age at diagnosis is 62 years overall; however, it is slightly lower for Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander (API), Black, and American Indian/Alaska Native (AIAN) women compared with White women.

#### Mortality
- **Death Estimates:**  
  About 43,250 women are projected to die from breast cancer in 2022. Nearly 91% of breast cancer deaths occur in women aged 50 and older, with half of all deaths occurring in women aged 70 or above.
  
- **Racial Disparities:**  
  Despite a slightly lower incidence rate among Black women compared with White women, Black women experience significantly higher mortality. Overall, the death rate among Black women is about 40% higher than that for White women, and in women under 50, mortality is nearly double. These differences are linked to factors such as later stage at diagnosis, higher prevalence of aggressive tumor subtypes (e.g., triple-negative breast cancer), and disparities in access to quality care.

#### Tumor Characteristics and Subtypes
- **Stage at Diagnosis:**  
  The report notes significant variation by stage—with higher survival for localized disease and lower survival for regional and distant stages. Racial and ethnic groups also differ in stage distribution; for example, Black women are more likely to be diagnosed with distant-stage disease.
  
- **Molecular Subtypes:**  
  Hormone receptor–positive/HER2–negative breast cancers are the most common across all groups, but Black women have a notably higher proportion of triple-negative (HR–/HER2–negative) tumors. This subtype is associated with poorer outcomes and fewer treatment options.

#### Screening and Treatment Patterns
- **Mammography:**  
  Screening plays a crucial role in early detection. Self-reported data show that up-to-date mammography prevalence among women aged ≥45 years varies by state—from about 56% in some states to 76% in others. However, screening rates are considerably lower among uninsured women.
  
- **Treatment Trends:**  
  While most early-stage patients receive breast-conserving surgery (often combined with radiation), a significant proportion—especially younger women and those with aggressive disease—undergo mastectomy. The use of advanced imaging and gene-expression assays (e.g., Oncotype DX) has influenced treatment decisions, particularly in guiding the use of chemotherapy.

### 4. Disparities and Their Implications

- **Racial/Ethnic Disparities:**  
  Despite overall improvements in survival, Black women continue to experience a 40% higher mortality rate compared with White women. The survival gap is especially pronounced for hormone receptor–positive/HER2–negative and HR–negative/HER2–positive subtypes and for women diagnosed at stage III. Contributing factors include:
  - Differences in tumor biology (e.g., a higher prevalence of triple-negative tumors among Black women).
  - Structural and systemic barriers that limit access to high-quality screening and timely, guideline-concordant treatment.
  - Socioeconomic factors and insurance disparities that lead to later-stage diagnoses and treatment delays.

- **Geographic Variations:**  
  There is considerable state-by-state variation in both incidence and mortality rates, reflecting differences in screening practices, risk factor prevalence, and health care access. For example, in some states, incidence rates among Black women exceed those of White women, while in others they are similar.

### 5. Conclusions and Future Directions

- **Overall Trends:**  
  Although incidence rates are slowly rising—primarily due to localized and HR-positive cancers—mortality has declined dramatically since 1989, largely as a result of improved treatments and early detection. Nonetheless, the decline in mortality has slowed recently.
  
- **Addressing Disparities:**  
  The persistent racial and ethnic disparities, particularly the higher mortality rates among Black women, underscore the urgent need for interventions. Strategies to improve outcomes include:
  - Expanding access to high-quality screening and treatment services (e.g., through Medicaid expansion).
  - Strengthening community partnerships and advocacy to address social determinants of health.
  - Ensuring that advances in treatment, such as targeted therapies and gene-expression assays, are equitably available.

- **Prevention Efforts:**  
  About 30% of breast cancer cases are linked to modifiable risk factors (e.g., excess body weight, physical inactivity, and alcohol intake). Continued public health efforts focused on lifestyle modifications and preventive screening could further reduce the burden of breast cancer.
