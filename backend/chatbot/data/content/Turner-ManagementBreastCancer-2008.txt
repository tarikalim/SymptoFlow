Overview

This clinical review examines recent advances in the local and primary management of breast cancer. Part I of a two-part series, the article focuses on preventive strategies, risk reduction, early detection, and improvements in local therapy—including surgery and radiotherapy. In Part II (not covered here), the authors plan to review advances in systemic treatments.
Key Themes and Content
1. Primary Prevention and Risk Reduction

    Modifiable Risk Factors:
    The authors review evidence linking risk factors such as post‐menopausal obesity, sedentary lifestyle, high alcohol consumption, and lower rates of breastfeeding with increased breast cancer risk.
    Hormone Exposure:
    Prolonged exposure to exogenous oestrogen (e.g., through combined hormone replacement therapy) has been shown to increase the risk, whereas oestrogen-only therapy presents a lower risk.
    Dietary Factors:
    Although research has investigated dietary fat and dairy intake, no conclusive evidence exists apart from the link mediated through overall obesity.

2. Chemoprevention

    Selective Oestrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs):
    Randomised studies, primarily with tamoxifen, have demonstrated that 5–8 years of treatment can reduce the incidence of invasive breast cancer by around 38% among high-risk women (identified by family history or calculated risk scores).
    Raloxifene:
    Another SERM, raloxifene, shows a similar preventive effect in post-menopausal women, although both agents have not been shown to reduce breast cancer–specific mortality.
    Side Effects and Limitations:
    The review discusses side effects such as increased risks of endometrial cancer, venous thromboembolism, stroke, and cataracts with tamoxifen—though these are less common with raloxifene. Importantly, the reduction in incidence does not necessarily translate into a survival benefit.

3. Screening and Early Detection

    Mammography:
    The article examines the benefits and limitations of mammographic screening. Although a Cochrane review suggested a modest mortality reduction (~15%), other analyses indicate greater benefits. However, overdiagnosis remains a concern.
    Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):
    For high-risk women, particularly those with a strong family history or genetic predisposition (e.g., BRCA mutations), MRI is noted to be more sensitive than mammography. Yet, cost, resource constraints, and issues with specificity (and thus false positives) limit its widespread adoption.
    Guidance for Non-Specialists:
    The authors emphasize that any patient presenting with potential breast symptoms should be urgently referred for specialist evaluation. Women with a strong family history should also be considered for further genetic risk assessment.

4. Advances in Surgical Management

    Breast-Conserving Surgery vs Mastectomy:
    With improvements in imaging and diagnostics, breast-conserving surgery (wide local excision) has become the preferred option when feasible. Mastectomy is reserved for larger or multifocal tumors or patient preference.
    Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy:
    This minimally invasive procedure is now accepted as standard for axillary staging, reducing morbidity (e.g., lymphedema) compared with full axillary dissection.
    Oncoplastic and Minimally Invasive Techniques:
    Advances include improved oncoplastic surgery techniques that optimize cosmetic outcomes and new approaches such as endoscopic mastectomy and endoscopic removal of axillary nodes.

5. Radiotherapy Advances

    Optimised Schedules:
    Newer radiotherapy regimens, including accelerated and hypofractionated schedules, can deliver effective treatment over shorter periods—improving patient convenience and reducing costs.
    Partial Breast Irradiation:
    Emerging techniques such as intraoperative radiotherapy and brachytherapy (e.g., MammoSite) are being investigated, though they remain largely within the clinical trial setting or specialized centers.

6. Implications and Ongoing Research

    Impact on Mortality:
    The review notes that in the Western world, improvements in screening, local management, and multimodal treatment have contributed to a decline in breast cancer mortality by over 25% in recent decades.
    Future Directions:
    Ongoing research is required to better define optimal screening strategies (e.g., the role of MRI), refine surgical techniques, and improve patient selection for chemoprevention. Studies are also underway to understand interactions between environmental risk factors and genetic predispositions.

7. Practical Tips for Non-Specialists

    Referral and Assessment:
    Any patient with a potential breast abnormality should be referred promptly to a specialist breast clinic.
    Risk Assessment:
    Women with a significant family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer should receive comprehensive genetic risk assessment.

Conclusion

Turner and Jones review a range of recent advances in the management of breast cancer with a particular focus on primary prevention, early detection, and improvements in local treatment. They emphasize that while significant progress has been made in reducing mortality and morbidity, breast cancer remains a major cause of cancer-related death. The review sets the stage for the subsequent part, which will focus on systemic treatments, underscoring the need for individualized treatment strategies informed by an evolving understanding of breast cancer biology.

This detailed summary outlines the article’s discussion of preventive strategies, screening advances, surgical innovations, and radiotherapy improvements, as well as their implications for improving breast cancer outcomes.
