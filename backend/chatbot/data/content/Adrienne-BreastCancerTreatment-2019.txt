Cadherins and catenins in breast cancer
Pamela Cowin, Tracey M Rowlands and Sarah J Hatsell
Recent studies show that cadherins and catenins are
hormonally regulated and carry out physiological roles during
mammary development but have pathological effects when
deregulated. E-cadherin expression is irreversibly lost in
invasive lobular breast cancer (ILC). Animal models of ILC
provide mechanistic insight, confirming that E-cadherin serves
as both a tumor suppressor and an invasion suppressor in ILC.
Ductal breast cancer involves complex, reversible, epigenetic
modulation of multiple cadherins. Transcriptional regulators of
E-cadherin have been identified that induce epithelial-tomesenchymal transitions. Catenins are lost or mislocalized in
tumors lacking cadherins. However, b-catenin signaling is
upregulated by numerous pathways in >50% of breast tumors
and animal models suggest its oncogenic function in breast
relates to its role in mammary progenitor cell expansion.

Introduction
Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy in women.
Though most breast cancers are benign and curable by
surgery, one-quarter have a latent and insidious character,
growing slowly but metastasizing early. Current therapies
delay tumor progression significantly, but recurrence is
inevitable, resulting in high mortality rates. The seeds of
breast cancer cell behavior are sown in their origin.
Embryonic mammary cells are imbued with motile and
invasive properties, and cell movement and changes in
cell contact characterize mammary development
(Figure 1) [1].
Mammary ducts and alveoli, which form cyclically during
pregnancy, are bilayered epithelial structures enclosing a
central lumen (Figure 2). Lumenal cells adhere to one
another via E-cadherin, which is also required for mammary cell survival [2,3]. Myoepithelial cells surround
www.sciencedirect.com

the lumenal layer and adhere to one another via Pcadherin. P-cadherin / mice undergo precocious mammary development [4], which suggests that loosening of
myoepithelial cell junctions triggers ductal branching,
possibly by allowing lumenal cells or basal/intermediate
progenitors greater access to basement membrane signals.
Desmosomal cadherins, desmogleins (Dsg) and desmocollins (Dsc) interconnect the lumenal and myoepithelial
layers and are critical for establishing this bilayered
arrangement [5]. H-cadherin is expressed in normal mammary ducts, and cadherin 11 (OB-cadherin) and N-cadherin are found in mammary tumor cell lines but have
unknown expression patterns in the normal gland [6â€“9].
All these proteins have documented roles in breast cancer. This review focuses on the contributions of cadherins
and their associated catenins to this disease.

E-cadherin and breast cancer
The association between loss or downregulation of Ecadherin and the progression of sporadic breast cancer has
been extensively documented. Both irreversible and
reversible mechanisms are at play and the prevalence
of each is related to the histological subtype. E-cadherin
expression is irreversibly lost in >85% of invasive lobular
breast cancers (ILCs). This results from loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 16q22.1, involving the E-cadherin
gene CDH1 (>50%), frequently in combination with
mutation (50%) or epigenetic silencing of the remaining
CDH1 allele [10â€“12]. The 15% of ILCs that retain Ecadherin expression show non-polarized mislocalization,
suggesting that adhesion is dysfunctional [11]. The diffuse growth patterns and loss of cellular coherence that
characterize ILCs are in keeping with early studies on
breast cancer cell lines, which correlated low E-cadherin
expression with invasive properties, defining E-cadherin
as an invasion-suppressor gene [13,14]. The prevalence of
E-cadherin loss in non-invasive precursor lesions known
as lobular carcinomas in situ (LCIS) suggests that Ecadherin is a tumor- as well as an invasion-suppressor.
However, the tumor-suppressor role of E-cadherin is not
completely clarified, as CDH1 germ-line mutations confer only a slight increase in breast cancer risk and are
rarely present in familial breast cancer [11,12]. In mice,
conditional deletion of one E-cadherin allele in lumenal
cells or basal/intermediate cells has no effect and homozygous inactivation results in apoptosis rather than tumorigenesis [2,3]. However, K14-cre-mediated deletion of
both E-cadherin and p53 leads to survival of E-cadherinnegative cells, resulting in tumors that recapitulate features of ILC. This mouse model provides important
insight into the cell type from which ILC originates
and the mechanisms by which the two most frequent

Embryonic and adult development in mouse mammary gland. Around embryonic day 10 (E10), mammary cells migrate along bilateral epidermal
thickenings called milk lines and coalesce at intervals to form placodes. Placode signals specify the underlying mammary mesenchyme, which
reciprocates, inducing epithelial invasion to form the mammary buds (E13). Parathyroid related protein (PTHrP) and Lef1 induce sprouting and
branching, resulting in formation of the mammary rudiment. The gland stays quiescent until puberty when estrogen and growth hormone (GH)
stimulate stromal IGF-1 to induce proliferation of cap cells within the terminal end buds, producing rapid ductal elongation. In early pregnancy,
progesterone receptor (PR) and Wnt 4 stimulate side branching. Alveologenesis occurs in mid to late pregnancy and is controlled by b-catenin,
C/EBP, Stat5, prolactin (PRL), cyclin D1 and RANKL. At the cessation of lactation, involution is mediated by MMPs, Stat3 and IGF binding
protein (IGBP) and the gland undergoes remodeling to resemble a virgin gland.

genetic events in human breast cancer (i.e. loss of p53 and
loss of E-cadherin) contribute to tumor initiation and
progression [3].
LOH at 16q also occurs in 50% of the more common
ductal breast cancers. In contrast to ILC, ductal tumors
lack mutations in the remaining CDH1 allele and show
highly variable E-cadherin expression. Where E-cadherin
levels are reduced, this is caused by epigenetic silencing
via promoter hypermethylation or transcriptional repression [11,12]. Reports are conflicted as to the usefulness
of E-cadherin expression as an independent prognostic
indicator in ductal breast cancer. In general, retention of
Current Opinion in Cell Biology 2005, 17:499â€“508

E-cadherin expression correlates with well-differentiated, non-invasive properties [11]. However, E-cadherin
expression is retained in inflammatory breast cancer, an
extremely aggressive sub-type [15]. Also, derivative
metastases frequently show strong E-cadherin expression
[16]. One emerging opinion is that dynamic, reversible
modulation of E-cadherin occurs during ductal carcinoma
progression. Reduced E-cadherin expression favors dissemination, but regaining expression favors survival and
reattachment of metastases. Downregulation of Dsc3 or
of desmosomal plaque proteins has been reported in
poorly differentiated and invasive ductal carcinomas
[17,18]. Thus desmosomes may also suppress metastasis.

the cap cells. Macrophages stimulated by colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) are required for ductal elongation. (b) A cross-section through the
mammary duct, showing adherens junctions containing P-cadherin between myoepithelial cells and E-cadherin between luminal epithelial cells.
Desmosomal cadherins link the two cell types. Basal/intermediate cells, which are a putative stem/progenitor population, are also indicated.

Cadherin regulation
The complexities of the intracellular pathways that regulate cadherin expression are not yet fully understood,
but several key transcription factors with significant roles
in breast cancer have been identified (Figure 3). The
zinc-finger transcription factors Snail, SLUG, ZEB1(@EF1) and smad-interacting protein (SIP-1) bind to
one of three E-boxes in the E-cadherin promoter and
repress expression [19,20,21]. In cancer, Snail upregulation is associated with the epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) and correlates with disappearance of
adherens junctions, profound morphological changes, and
enhanced migratory and invasive capabilities [22]. In
keeping with its role as a transcriptional repressor, upregulation of Snail has been correlated with advanced, dedifferentiated tumors lacking E-cadherin expression [22].
However, another study in breast cancer cell lines suggested that presence of the related factor Slug correlates
www.sciencedirect.com

more strongly than Snail with lack of E-cadherin [19].
Other negative regulators of E-cadherin include b-catenin, Kaiso, E12/E47 and Twist. Twist upregulation correlates with E-cadherin downregulation in metastatic
breast tumor cell lines and invasive lobular carcinomas
[23]. Suppression of Twist reduced intravasation of
metastatic tumor cells without affecting their proliferation or survival. The activation of these transcription
factors in cancer is likely to be a remnant of their roles
as master regulators of EMT during development. However, reintroduction of E-cadherin to cells that have
undergone Twist-induced EMT failed to rectify the
phenotype, suggesting the essential involvement of additional Twist target genes in this event [23].
Upstream of these transcriptional changes, TGF-b, which
is upregulated in E-cadherin-negative carcinomas, has
been shown to activate SIP-1 and Snail and to stimulate

Figure 3

Early non-invasive tumor cells express epithelial markers such as E-cadherin. Induction of regulators of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT), such as Twist, SIP, Slug and Snail, repress E-cadherin transcription in cancer cells, causing downregulation of other adhesive epithelial
markers. Mesenchymal markers such as N-cadherin are induced in these cancer cells. This leads to a less adhesive, more motile cell morphology
that allows local invasion, intravasation and subsequent metastasis.

EMT in cultured mammary cells [24,25]. In these cells,
TGF-b represses E-cadherin and also upregulates Ncadherin by a mechanism that is yet to be defined.
However, although these changes in cadherin expression
accompany the morphological EMT, they do not cause it
[24]. Activation of HER2/neu (ErbB2) represses E-cadherin transcription, leading to EMT in human mammary
epithelial cells, while EGFR, Ep-CAM and MUC-1/episialin inactivate E-cadherin by disrupting its association
with the cytoskeleton [1].
Several studies have shown that steroid hormones regulate cadherins. A connection between estrogen and both
N- and E-cadherin expression has long been postulated
from in vivo studies, and an imperfect estrogen response
element may be involved in upregulation of E-cadherin
transcription by estrogen [26]. Estrogen receptor (ER)
indirectly stimulates estrogen-dependent expression of
metastatic tumor antigen 3 (MTA3), a component of Mi2/NuRD, a nucleosome-remodeling and deacetylation
complex; in turn, MTA3 transcriptionally represses Snail
[27]. Thus, estrogen is proposed to maintain epithelial
architecture by constraining Snail repression of E-cadherin [27]. These studies suggest a mechanistic link
Current Opinion in Cell Biology 2005, 17:499â€“508

between ER-negative status and loss of E-cadherin, leading to EMT and tumor invasion, and provide an explanation for the poor prognosis of ER- negative breast cancers.
Collectively, these data begin to explain the mechanisms
that may connect cadherins with other key prognosticators in breast cancer; it is likely that many more interdependencies will be revealed.

Cadherin switching
Several studies on human breast cancer cell lines have
delved into the functional consequences of differential
cadherin expression. Though early studies correlated low
E-cadherin expression with invasive properties, other
studies have found that increased N-cadherin and cadherin-11 levels are more closely associated with invasion,
motility and metastasis of breast cancer cells [7â€“9].
Forced expression of E-cadherin in such cell lines failed
to rectify their invasive phenotype, revealing a dominant
role for N-cadherin. The effects of N-cadherin are linked
to its association with FGFR-1 [7,8]. Hazan and colleagues demonstrated that N-cadherin stabilizes FGFR-1,
thereby sensitizing breast cancer cells to FGF2 stimulation, which results in sustained activation of the MAPK
pathway and increased expression of matrix-metalloprowww.sciencedirect.com

Cadherins and catenins in breast cancer Cowin, Rowlands and Hatsell 503

teinase (MMP)-9 [28]. N-cadherin additionally facilitates
invasion and metastasis by promoting tumor cell affinity
for stromal and endothelial cells [6,8,28]. These studies
provided a compelling picture of the potential consequences of an E- to N-cadherin switch; however, the
incidence of this switch in breast tumors and the pathological consequences remained uncertain. Recent studies
suggested that no phenotypic or pathological consequence results from MMTV-N-cadherin misexpression
in the mammary glands of wild-type mice or in the
MMTV-HER2/neu tumorigenesis model [29]. However,
Hazan and colleagues have found a strong association
between N-cadherin expression and progression of the
highly invasive micropapillary carcinoma of breast [30].
Other reports have found stronger correlations between
misexpression of P-cadherin and breast cancer progression [31]. P-cadherin expression is associated with high
histological grade of ER-negative ductal carcinoma in situ
(DCIS) and invasive carcinomas [31]. By contrast, misexpression of MMTV-P-cadherin in luminal epithelial
cells had no effect in wild-type or MMTV-HER2/neu
mice [32]. Thus, although the clinical correlations
between P-cadherin expression and cancer progression
appear to be robust, the mechanistic connection has not
yet been determined.
One question raised by the analyses of breast cancer cell
lines is whether the expression of multiple cadherins
represents a pathological cause or effect or instead results
from the expansion of a particular cell lineage. Though Ecadherin and P-cadherin are restricted to lumenal cells
and myoepithelial cells respectively, several studies suggest these cell types can interconvert in vitro and derive
from a common progenitor [33]. Thus, breast cell lines
expressing multiple cadherins may represent transformed
populations of bipotent stem progenitors.

Catenins
Cadherins associate with catenins, which connect the
adhesion complex to the actin cytoskeleton [1]. In addition to facilitating adhesion, catenins have important roles
in many signaling pathways. Junctional catenin expression is often lost in cadherin-negative breast cancer and
changes in catenin phosphorylation may compromise
adhesion in cadherin-positive cancers. For example,
a-catenin is downregulated more often than E-cadherin
in breast cancer and correlates with poor prognosis [34].
Alternatively-spliced isoforms of p120 catenin bind to the
juxtamembrane domain of E-cadherin and influence cell
adhesion, either positively or negatively. Membrane localization of p120 is reduced in many ductal carcinomas and
becomes predominantly cytoplasmic in the majority of
LCIS and invasive lobular carcinomas, correlating with
loss of E-cadherin [35]. p120 isoform 1 is associated with
a motile cell phenotype and is increased upon loss of
E-cadherin and induction of N-cadherin [35]. p120 also
www.sciencedirect.com

binds to and inhibits the function of Kaiso, a BTB/POZ
zinc finger transcription repressor. Kaiso target genes
include E-cadherin, MMP7, MTA2 and the non-canonical Wnt-11. Nuclear Kaiso was seen at the periphery of
some breast adenocarcinomas and cytoplasmic staining
colocalizing with p120 was seen in the center of the tumor
[36]. Cytoplasmic p120 could function to sequester
Kaiso, leading to target gene derepression.
b-catenin has critical roles in morphogenesis and human
cancer, through its dual function in adhesive complexes
and as a transducer/transcriptional regulator in numerous
signal transduction pathways, including the canonical
Wnt pathway [1]. In mice, it has long been known that
misexpression of Wnt-1, Wnt-3 or Wnt-10b induces mammary adenocarcinomas [37]. These â€˜transformingâ€™ Wnts
increase b-catenin signaling in mammary cell lines, suggesting their proto-oncogenic effects could be conveyed
by the canonical b-catenin pathway [37]. Consistent with
this view, the APCMin mouse shows an enhanced incidence (10%) of spontaneous mammary cancer and greatly
increased susceptibility (90%) to carcinogen-induced
mammary cancer [38]. Mutations in b-cateninâ€™s N-terminal destruction box are found in mouse mammary tumors
induced by 1,3-butadiene [39]. The findings that
MMTV-DN89b-catenin induces adenocarcinomas and
that K5-DN57b-catenin induces basal-type carcinomas
in mouse mammary gland show that stabilized b-catenin
is oncogenic in both lumenal and basal/intermediate cell
types within breast [40,41].
In human breast cancers, there are many reports of
inactivation of negative regulators of the Wnt pathway
and of amplification or overexpression of positively acting
pathway components (Figure 4). DVL-1, encoding
Disheveled (Dsh), a downstream Wnt activator, is amplified and upregulated in 50% of ductal breast cancers [42].
FRP1/FRZB, which is located at 8p11â€“21 and encodes
frizzled-related protein 1 (Frp1), a secreted Wnt inhibitor,
is frequently deleted. Frp1 expression is repressed or
absent in 80% of malignant breast carcinomas, making
it one of the most frequent alterations in breast cancer
[43]. Axin, which destabilizes b-catenin, is downregulated
in a small percentage of breast cancers [44]. AXIN2 maps
to 17q23â€“q24, which shows frequent LOH in breast
cancer [45]. The APC gene is subject to LOH (23â€“
40%), mutation (6â€“18%) and hypermethylation, resulting
in loss of expression in 36â€“50% of breast tumors [46â€“48].
Stabilizing N-terminal b-catenin mutations have not
been found in breast cancer. However, eight studies have
reported b-catenin upregulation in human breast tumors
and two have correlated this feature, in association with
other markers, with poor clinical outcome [42,44,46,49â€“
51,52,53]. In addition to the potential for Wnt-dependent upregulation of b-catenin detailed above, it is well
documented that b-catenin stability is regulated by

A diagram of the signaling pathways acting on b-catenin (shown in red) that are involved in breast cancer. The most studied of these is the
Wnt pathway, which stabilizes b-catenin by inhibiting its N-terminal phosphorylations and ubiquitination. This allows b-catenin to accumulate,
enter the nucleus and derepress Lef/Tcf target genes. Other factors also stabilize b-catenin, such as Pin-1 and IKKa. p53, which is commonly
mutated in breast cancer, promotes b-catenin degradation through activation of either GSK3b or the Skp/Siah/Ebi complex. PTEN decreases
b-catenin signaling by inhibiting the PI3K pathway, which stabilizes b-catenin by inactivating GSK3b. TGFb has complex effects on b-catenin.
It can reduce signaling by inhibiting Lef/Tcfs through NLK or co-activate target genes through Smads.

numerous Wnt-independent mechanisms. Many of the
key proteins in these pathways (PTEN, ILK, IKKa,
IKKb, Pin1 and p53) are deregulated or mutated in a
significant proportion of sporadic and inherited breast
cancer [1]. For example, Pin1, which is upregulated in
80% of breast cancers, stabilizes b-catenin by inhibiting its
association with APC [50,54]. PTEN and p53 mutations
underlie Cowdenâ€™s and Li Fraumeni syndromes, respectively, which are associated with increased predisposition
to breast cancer. b-catenin and p53 (the most frequently
mutated gene in sporadic breast cancer) reciprocally regulate one another in a complex fashion. b-catenin upregulates p53, and p53 destabilizes b-catenin, via both GSK3b-dependent and Siah-dependent mechanisms [55,56].
One gene expression study has reported b-catenin upregulation concomitant with downregulation of both Siah
and Axin in 30% of tumors [44]. Another study has shown
that a population with increased b-catenin and p53 has a
significantly worse clinical outcome [52]. Thus, a significant synergism exists between p53 and b-catenin in
breast cancer, which has recently been confirmed by the
development of a mouse model [57].
Several studies have correlated increased b-catenin with
upregulation of its target genes [49,50]. Of these targets,
cyclin D1 and c-myc are upregulated in a significant
proportion (40%) of breast cancers, while Twist is strongly
associated with invasive properties, E-cadherin is a breast
tumor suppressor and CD44 has been identified as a
breast cancer stem cell marker [58]. Thus b-catenin
has the potential to be a master regulator of many known
prognostic indicators of breast cancer.
An important question is how b-cateninâ€™s function in
mammary development relates to its role in breast cancer.
Canonical Wnt/b-catenin pathways are critical for both
embryonic and adult mammary development. Embryonic
mammary buds activate Tcf/Lef target genes and fail to
form or elongate in mice where Wnt/b-catenin signaling is
blocked by expression of Dikkopf (Dkk) or by loss of Lef1 [59â€“61]. Expression of Axin or of a dominant-negative
repressor of b-catenin signaling (b-eng) inhibits alveologenesis during pregnancy [40,62,63]. A connection
between development and breast cancer is suggested
by the phenotype of the MMTV-DN89b-catenin mice.
MMTV-DN89b-catenin induces precocious alveologenesis in virgin mice that rapidly develops into adenocarcinomas [40]. Significantly, these hyperplasias and tumors
are enriched in cells displaying stem/progenitor attributes
[40,64â€“67]. These progenitors accrue when differentiation is blocked by the absence of cyclin D1 and tumors
form more rapidly. Thus, tumor incidence correlates
proportionally with the number of stem/progenitor cells
in these mice [64]. These studies add to an increasing
number of reports showing that organs in which b-catenin
causes tumors correspond to those in which it has a role in
stem or progenitor cell renewal.
www.sciencedirect.com

Recent data have provided evidence that some human
breast tumors are formed by cancer stem cells (CSCs)
expressing CD44, a known b-catenin target gene [58].
This study found that only CD44-expressing cells (which
make up <1% of the tumor) are capable of regenerating
tumors when transplanted into murine mammary fatpads. These cells regenerate the full spectrum of cell
types found in the original tumor and thus display classical stem cell features, being capable of self-renewal and
generating differentiated progeny. A stem cell origin
would explain the latency and high rates of remission
associated with breast cancer. Stem cells are predisposed
to accumulate mutations and their mitotic quiescence
and expression of multi-drug resistance transporters, such
as BRCP-1, permit them to export and elude anti-mitotic
chemotherapeutic agents. Stem cells and CSCs, however,
are not necessarily synonymous. Data from the hematopoietic system have suggested that CSCs may derive
from lineage-limited progenitors that gain self-renewal
capacity during transformation in a b-catenin-dependent
manner. The accumulation of alveolar progenitors in
the MMTV-DN89b-catenin mouse and their predisposition to develop tumors is entirely consistent with this
scenario.

Conclusions
Recent studies have provided important mechanistic
insights into the roles of cadherins and catenins in breast
cancer. Animal models have confirmed the causative role
for E-cadherin in ILC suggested by earlier studies on
breast cancer cell lines. The importance of misexpression
of N- and P-cadherin has been revealed by their experimental misexpression in breast cells and by analysis of
their expression in breast tumors. Transcriptional regulators of E-cadherin that can act as master controllers of
the EMT have been identified. Connections between
hormones and cadherin and catenin function have provided important insights into breast cancer. b-catenin
upregulation has proven to be a frequent event in breast
tumors and animal models link its oncogenic potential to
the expansion of mammary progenitor populations. Identification of the cell types that undergo b-catenin-dependent self-renewal in breast during mammary
development and those that can acquire this behavior
during transformation remains an important future
imperative.

express lumenal cytokeratins, derive from the basal/intermediate progenitors. Abrogation of p53 permits the E-cadherin-null cells to escape
apoptosis and form highly invasive tumors that recapitulate several
stages of tumor progression.
