Abstract Summary:
Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors, when combined with endocrine therapy, have become the standard-of-care for patients with advanced hormone receptor-positive, HER2 non-amplified (HR+HER2–) breast cancer and are also being used in the adjuvant setting for high-risk early stage disease. Despite their remarkable impact on progression-free survival, challenges remain regarding acquired resistance, patient selection, optimal treatment timing, and sequencing. This review outlines the biological rationale for targeting CDK4/6, summarizes the most recent clinical evidence—including comparisons among the approved inhibitors—and discusses future research directions to overcome resistance and refine treatment strategies.
