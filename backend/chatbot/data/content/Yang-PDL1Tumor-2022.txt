Abstract Summary

Background:

    Atezolizumab (Tecentriq) is approved for use in advanced triple‑negative breast cancer (TNBC) in combination with nab‑paclitaxel, based on the IMpassion130 trial that used PD‑L1 expression in immune cells as a biomarker.
    However, the subsequent IMpassion131 study did not confirm the benefit, leading to withdrawal of the indication.
    Emerging evidence suggests that heavy N‑glycosylation of PD‑L1 may lead to false‑negative immunohistochemical (IHC) results, thereby underestimating true PD‑L1 levels.
    This study investigates whether de‑glycosylating PD‑L1 in tumor tissues improves its detection and better predicts responsiveness to atezolizumab.

Methods:

    Patient Cohort: Tumor samples from nine advanced breast cancer patients (including TNBC cases) were analyzed.
    IHC Protocol:
        Standard IHC staining using the anti‑PD‑L1 clone 28‑8 was performed on formalin‑fixed, paraffin‑embedded tissue sections.
        A de‑glycosylation step using PNGase F was applied to remove N‑linked glycosylation from PD‑L1.
    Scoring Systems:
        Four scoring systems were utilized:
            Tumor Proportion Score (TPS): Percentage of PD‑L1‑positive tumor cells.
            H‑score-M: Quantification of membranous PD‑L1 staining.
            H‑score-M+C: Combined membranous and cytoplasmic PD‑L1 staining.
            Immune Cell (IC) Score: Percentage of tumor area occupied by PD‑L1‑positive immune cells.
    Data Analysis:
        Comparisons were made between natural (non‑de‑glycosylated) and de‑glycosylated PD‑L1 staining.
        Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed to derive optimal cut-off points for predicting treatment response.
        Correlations with clinical outcomes, including progression‑free survival (PFS) and treatment response (CR, PR, SD vs. PD), were evaluated.

Results:

    Enhanced PD‑L1 Detection:
        De‑glycosylation markedly enhanced PD‑L1 detection on the tumor cell membrane.
        In most cases, PD‑L1 levels (as measured by TPS and H‑score-M) were significantly increased after de‑glycosylation.
    Correlation with Clinical Response:
        Patients who responded to atezolizumab (complete response, partial response, or stable disease) had significantly higher de‑glycosylated PD‑L1 levels compared with non‑responders.
        ROC analyses demonstrated that the optimal cut‑off points for de‑glycosylated PD‑L1 (both TPS and H‑score‑M) predicted treatment response with higher accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity than median cut‑offs.
        In contrast, the conventional criteria (based on natural PD‑L1 staining in immune cells, as used in the IMpassion trials) did not correlate well with clinical outcomes.
    Survival Correlation:
        Lower de‑glycosylated TPS levels were associated with poorer progression‑free survival, underscoring the potential of this modified scoring method in predicting benefit from atezolizumab.

Conclusions:

    The study demonstrates that de‑glycosylation enhances the detection of membrane PD‑L1 in tumor tissues.
    De‑glycosylated PD‑L1 levels (measured by TPS and H‑score‑M) correlate significantly with response to atezolizumab in advanced breast cancer patients.
    These findings suggest that de‑glycosylated PD‑L1 may serve as a more reliable biomarker for selecting patients likely to benefit from anti‑PD‑L1 therapy compared to conventional IHC methods.
    Further validation in larger, multi‑institutional cohorts is warranted to optimize patient stratification for atezolizumab treatment.
