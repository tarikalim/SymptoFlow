Overview

This editorial from 1954 discusses the early exploration of hormone treatments in breast cancer. The article highlights the concept that oestrogens and androgens have antagonistic biological activities, a principle first demonstrated in animal studies where parabiosis between male and female mice prevented the development of mammary carcinoma in the female partner. Over time, clinicians began to investigate how manipulation of hormonal environments—such as oophorectomy (ovary removal) and the administration of testosterone—could influence breast cancer development and treatment outcomes.
Key Points

    Hormonal Antagonism:
    Early experiments demonstrated that oestrogens and androgens counteract each other. In high cancer–strain mice joined in parabiosis, the female mice, which typically developed mammary carcinoma, did not develop the disease when exposed to male hormonal influences.

    Historical Perspectives:
        In 1829, Astley Cooper suggested a functional relationship between the ovary and the mammary gland.
        By 1896, oophorectomy was advocated and performed as a treatment for breast cancer, although complete tumor regression was rare.
        Later work by Beatson and others introduced bilateral ovariectomy and, alternatively, irradiation as treatment methods, with variable outcomes.

    Animal Experiments:
    Studies in mice demonstrated that the ovaries play a significant role in mammary carcinogenesis. For example, castration or removal of ovarian function led to reduced incidence of breast cancer, although the response was not universal.

    Clinical Applications:
    Early clinical applications included the use of high doses of testosterone propionate for advanced breast carcinoma. Although these hormonal treatments occasionally resulted in prolonged survival (with some patients surviving six to seven years after treatment initiation), the overall impact was limited. The editorial also notes that endocrine therapies based on massive doses of oestrogen were used in the treatment of breast cancer, with varying degrees of success in achieving regression of advanced disease.

    Endocrine Considerations:
    The editorial discusses the dual role of the ovaries in both promoting and maintaining breast cancer growth through estrogen production, as well as the potential role of androgens. It also points out that certain tumors may be adrenal-dependent rather than ovarian-dependent, and that treatments such as adrenalectomy or the use of cortisone have been explored for non-oestrogen-dependent cancers.

    Future Directions:
    The author emphasizes that while hormone treatments offered promising avenues, complete and sustained remission was rarely achieved. The variability in tumor response highlights the complexity of hormonal influences in breast cancer, suggesting that future research should focus on better understanding steroid metabolism and the endocrine environment of breast tissue.

Conclusion

The editorial concludes that hormone treatment—whether through surgical removal of the ovaries, hormonal manipulation, or irradiation—represents a promising but imperfect strategy in the management of breast cancer. Although significant progress has been made in understanding the endocrine aspects of breast cancer, the results underscore the challenges inherent in achieving complete tumor regression. This early work laid the foundation for subsequent advances in hormonal therapy for breast cancer.
