A comprehensive review of breast cancer therapies and formulations is presented. The article details the development, mechanisms of action, clinical applications, and limitations of various anticancer drugs. It discusses cytotoxic agents, hormonal therapies, targeted therapies, nanomedicine approaches, and novel formulations under clinical trial.

For example, Cyclophosphamide, first approved in 1959, is used in neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and metastatic settings (FDA, 2012c; FDA, 2013). Similarly, Doxorubicin Hydrochloride is described as a key agent for metastatic breast cancer, with various liposomal formulations (FDA, 2012a; Pearce et al., 2012).

The review also presents detailed tables. Table 1 provides a comprehensive account of commercial formulations of drugs approved for first-line, neoadjuvant, and adjuvant therapy in breast cancer—from 1953 to 2023. It lists drug names, year of approval, dosage forms, notable formulations, manufacturers, recommended doses, conditions of breast cancer, drug delivery type, and references. Table 2 lists various novel formulations in clinical trials along with the drug, type of novel formulation (e.g., nanoparticles, liposomes, nanogels), the condition of breast cancer, NCT number, clinical trial phase, and supporting references.

The text explains that drugs used to treat breast cancer are considered systemic therapies because they can reach cancer cells throughout the body. Some agents are administered orally, while others are given via intravenous injection or infusion. The review emphasizes that the choice of therapy depends on the type and stage of breast cancer, with combination therapies often used to enhance treatment outcomes and minimize side effects.

The discussion section underlines that despite decades of progress, no single drug or combination is entirely free of adverse effects. The evolution of drug discovery—from the early use of cytotoxic agents to the more recent introduction of targeted therapies and nanomedicine-based delivery systems—has significantly improved survival and quality of life for breast cancer patients (Zardavas and Piccart-Gebhart, 2016; Waks and Winer, 2019; Junnuthula et al., 2022).

The review concludes that this exhaustive article serves as a one-stop reference for breast oncology scientists and clinicians. It aims to streamline data retrieval and facilitate further research in formulation development by providing comprehensive details on approved drugs, their clinical formulations, novel drug delivery systems, and emerging formulations in clinical trials.
