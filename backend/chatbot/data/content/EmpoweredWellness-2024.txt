Overview

Empowered Wellness focuses on navigating breast cancer with strength and knowledge. In a time when approximately 310,720 women in the United States are estimated to be diagnosed with breast cancer in 2024, early detection remains critical in the fight against the disease. This issue underscores the importance of vigilance, regular screenings, and awareness of risk factors.
Key Message from Dr. Zakia Williams-Greene, Ph.D.

Dr. Zakia Williams-Greene, Senior Pharmacologist at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration—and a breast cancer survivor herself—shares her personal journey and professional insights. She emphasizes that:

    Early Detection is Key:
    Regular self-breast exams and annual mammograms can catch breast cancer in its earliest, most treatable stages. Early detection dramatically improves treatment success and survival rates.

    Understanding Risk Factors:
    While genetic predispositions (such as BRCA mutations) are important, 85% of breast cancer cases occur in women with no family history. Other risk factors include dense breast tissue, a history of benign breast conditions, and reproductive factors like early menstruation or late menopause.

    The Importance of Genetic Testing:
    For women with a family history of breast cancer or related cancers, genetic testing can guide more aggressive preventive strategies—ranging from enhanced monitoring to considering preventive surgery.

    Support Systems Matter:
    A strong support network of family, friends, and healthcare professionals plays a critical role in the healing journey. In addition to conventional medical treatments, holistic practices like meditation, yoga, and art therapy can help manage stress and empower patients.

Dr. Williams-Greene’s work in ensuring the safety and efficacy of both generic and brand-name drugs has earned her the Women of Color 2024 Professional Achievement in Government Award. Her advocacy and expertise inspire women to remain proactive about their health and maintain regular screening routines.
Breast Health and Early Detection

    Mammograms:
    Mammograms are a valuable tool for early detection, with an approximate accuracy rate of 87%. However, there is a 7%–12% chance of false positives that may require additional testing.
    Tip: If you notice any unusual changes during self-exams, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

    Breast Self-Awareness:
    Understanding how your breasts normally look and feel is essential. Regular self-exams help you notice any new changes or symptoms early on.

    Screening Recommendations:
    Depending on individual risk factors, it is generally recommended to begin mammograms at age 40 or 45, with the frequency of screening increasing with age.

Empowerment Through Knowledge and Support

Empowered Wellness encourages women to:

    Stay informed about breast cancer risk factors and screening guidelines.
    Engage in regular screenings and be proactive about self-exams.
    Seek genetic counseling and testing if there is a family history of breast or related cancers.
    Build and lean on support systems—both personal and professional—to help navigate the challenges of a breast cancer diagnosis.
