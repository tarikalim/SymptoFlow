Future prospects for the prevention and cure of breast cancer


Breast cancer has been the subject of more clinical
trials than any other malignancy and this great collaborative eort has resulted in major bene®ts to many
women with the disease. In the past two decades the
standard treatment for the majority of those with early
breast cancer has changed from mastectomy to breast
conservation therapy. Those at risk of relapse can be
identi®ed and many bene®t from eective systemic
therapy. The disease is being diagnosed at a biologically
earlier stage as a result of screening which can achieve
up to a 40% reduction in mortality. Finally, as a byproduct of the trials of adjuvant endocrine therapy,
prevention trials have been conducted and some appear
to show a significant efect.
All of this is encouraging but should not blind us to
the fact that there are still too many women dying of
breast cancer, some as a result of late diagnosis, some
because of the inherent aggressiveness of their disease
and others because they have been inadequately treated.
Future improvements will arise partly from the widespread adoption of the most eective known treatments
as a result of randomised clinical trials. Additionally, it
is to be hoped, new therapies will emerge from the
enormous amount of basic research which thus far has
had a disproportionately small impact on treatment of
the disease.
2. Prevention
To prevent breast cancer we need to know about both
the initiating and promoting stages which lead to clinical or pre-clinical manifestation. Initiation is poorly
understood but probably results from at least two


separate and successful carcinogenic assaults. The
majority of the epidemiological studies and, as a result,
the prevention trials have focused on promotion, that is
the eect of steroid hormones and their antagonists.
Most of the case±control or cohort studies have regarded the diagnosis of breast cancer as the end-point
without taking into account the type of tumour which
developed, either in terms of grade or oestrogen receptor (ER) status. Although it is possible that ER-negative
tumours will have passed through a phase of oestrogenic promotion, this is unlikely so it is possible that
almost all the epidemiological studies have not been
interpreted appropriately in terms of the aetiology of
those cancers which are most likely to kill women.
Conversely, most studies that have examined lifetime
oestrogen exposure either in terms of serum oestradiol
or the surrogate of high bone mineral density, have
shown that hyperoestrogenised individuals are at
increased risk of breast cancer . This is further
borne out by the small but signifcant efects of oral
contraceptive exposure in young women and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in those who are peri
or post-menopausal.
The impact of HRT on the prognosis of breast cancer
aords an important clue about oestrogens and their
eect on tumour development. Almost all studies have
shown a better survival for women diagnosed with
breast cancer while taking HRT compared with those of
the same age who have not taken HRT. It is a truism to
state that the promotional eect of oestrogens is to stimulate the growth of hormone sensitive breast cancers
that have a less aggressive biological behaviour. Use of
the selective oestrogen receptor modulator raloxifene as
a potential preventive agent has led to a significant
reduction in breast cancers in the treated compared with
the control group. This appears to be very encouraging but analysis of the tumours in the two groups
showed a signifcant effect on reducing the numbers of
ER-positive cancers but no dierence in ER-negative
tumours. Hence present endocrine-based prevention



strategies may not have any impact on the incidence of
the most aggressive ER-cancers.
From the moment that a breast cancer is detectable,
that is at the pre-invasive stage, the type of tumour is
pre-determined. Patients who have high grade ductal
carcinoma in situ (DCIS) are most likely to go on to
develop poorly differentiated invasive tumours. Individuals with low grade DCIS have a reduced likelihood of
progression to invasive disease, which when it occurs is
likely to be well differentiated. Furthermore phenotypic
drift of tumours is a rare event: loss of chromosome 16q
occurs in only 16% of grade III tumours compared with
65% of grade I cancers. To prevent women developing grade III breast cancers will require dierent intervention strategies from our present attempts to alter the
hormonal milieu and inhibit, for an unknown duration,
the manifestation of endocrine-dependent low grade
cancers.
We are able to identify the majority of the germ-cell
mutations responsible for breast cancer. These comprise
less than 10% of the entire cases but in population
terms constitute a large number of women at risk. There
are indications that these individuals with mutations of
BRCA1 have a p53-independent failure to repair DNA
damage. It appears that individuals who carry
mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 are more likely to
develop ER-negative in situ breast cancer. This may
explain in part the lack of ecacy of tamoxifen as a
preventive agent in the Royal Marsden Pilot Study
which largely comprised women with a strong family
history of breast cancer.
An alternative approach has to concentrate on the
anti-oxidant properties of carotenoids since consumption of vegetables rich in these appears to be associated
with a decrease in risk among premenopausal women. In a trial of the synthetic retinoid fenretinide in
women with early breast cancer there was no overall
eect on the prevention of a second malignancy.
However, there were fewer contralateral cancers in premenopausal women given fenretinide but more in the
postmenopausal group. At present there appears to be a
disparity between encouraging animal model results and
those in Homo sapiens.
In terms of initiating events, we know very little. Followup of survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs
has indicated that radiation can play such a role, particularly in those <10 years of age at exposure [12].
Moreover, ionising radiation may be carcinogenic at
relatively low dosages in the developing breast. Lowdose scalp irradiation for treatment of ringworm in
10 384 Israeli children led to an excess of breast cancers
(relative risk, RR: 2.9) after a follow-up of >30 years. Breast irradiation was used as treatment for
women with acute post-partum mastitis and was associated with a 4-fold increase in risk after 25 years of
follow-up. All these data underline the need to

protect the developing breast from ionising radiation.
An increased sensitivity of lymphocytes from breast
cancer patients to G2 phase irradiation suggests that
there may be an identi®able subset of high-risk cases
with an impaired ability to repair radiation-induced
DNA damage.
The major risk factor is increasing age and one of the
multiple changes associated with this physiological process is methylation of Cytosine phospho Guanine
(CpG) islands. Normally CpG islands are unmethylated
and need to remain so for gene transcription to occur:
methylation leads to silencing of the gene in which they
are located. In breast cancer cells poor expression of the
retinoic acid receptor b (RARb), a possible tumour suppressor gene, together with p16 and the ER gene has
been shown to result from methylation and this process
may be reversible with the DNA methylation inhibitor
5-aza-21-deoxy cytidine. Hence inhibition of DNA
methylation may provide a novel method of possibly
treating and preventing breast cancer.
That alcohol is implicated is becoming dicult to
ignore. For every 10 g/day of alcohol intake there is
a 9% increase in risk of breast cancer. There is still
considerable doubt as to whether this is an initiating
step as a result of increased intake of alcohol soluble
carcinogens or as an indirect endocrine eect. Alcohol
has been shown to produce elevation of blood and
urinary oestrogens. Irrespective of the reason, it is likely
that a reduction in alcohol consumption could lead to a
modest reduction in risk.
At present smoking is regarded as neutral in terms of
breast cancer risk. This is slightly surprising in that
smoking leads to a reduction in urinary oestrogens in
premenopausal women, elevation of androgens in
the postmenopausal, and an earlier menopause
which is normally found to be protective. Smokers are less likely to develop endometrial cancer
and are at increased risk of osteoporosis. This antioestrogenic action of smoking might lead to a reduction
in hormone-dependent breast cancers whilst of course
greatly increasing the risk of heart disease and lung
cancer. That the absolute numbers of breast cancers
appear to be the same in smokers and non-smokers may
be hiding a dierent distribution of tumour types. This
may emerge when the epidemiological studies are re-run
on a basis of dierent tumour types. Development of
more aggressive cancers in some smokers is suggested
by the results of Calle and colleagues who reported that
smokers of >40 cigarettes per day had a significantly
elevated (1.7) relative risk of dying of breast cancer
compared with non-smokers. It is likely that if an
association were demonstrated between poorly differentiated breast cancers and smoking that this might
have more of an effect on the smoking habits of young
women than any of the dire warnings about lung cancer
or cardiovascular disease.



3. Treatment
Several aspects of local treatment for early breast
cancer are under scrutiny since there has been a general
trend for the surgery to deal with smaller tumours to be
less extensive. These are being diagnosed as a result of
enhanced awareness and population screening.
Nevertheless, it must be remembered that small is not
necessarily beautiful Ð up to one third of tumours
measuring up to 1 cm in diameter may have metastasised to the axillary nodes. Failure to determine the
axillary nodal status will result in understaging and
undertreatment for some women.
The randomised trials which showed the equivalence
of breast conserving therapy and mastectomy included
radiotherapy as a component and when this was omitted a high breast relapse rate (40%) occurred. To
date, all trials that have compared radiation with no
radiation have shown an increased relapse rate in nonirradiated cases. Nevertheless, there are indications
that some post-menopausal women with ER-positive
tumours can be safely treated by a combination of
wide excision and axillary clearance without radiotherapy. After 39 months median follow-up, breast
relapse occurred in 16% of those aged 455 but only
3% of women aged >55 years. The approach of
replacing radiotherapy with tamoxifen may be particularly useful for the management of the increasing
numbers of older women with ER-positive breast
cancers.
Even after the most skilful surgery, there is a resultant
scar from tumour excision and if this could be avoided,
cosmesis would be greatly improved. Use of laser ®bres
to destroy the cancer is still experimental but holds great
promise for scar-free tumour extirpation. After years of
argument about surgical treatment of the axilla, surgeons eventually appreciated that the most major prognostic determinant was the status of the axillary nodes
but having learnt this lesson were then faced with the
apparent high sensitivity of sentinel node biopsy.
At present attention is being concentrated on teaching
or learning the technique and determining whether
radio-isotopic or dye localisation achieves a more
representative node yield. On the assumption that the
technique does become widely mastered, and this is
debatable, there remain questions to be answered. How
low a sensitivity will be acceptable 
Even in the best hands there will be false-negative sentinel nodes, sometimes because the process of metastasis
has blocked the aerent lymphatics. It is possible that
this could be circumvented by using a double isotope
technique with the second isotope administered intravenously (i.v.) tagged to a mammary epithelial marker
such as MUC-1. Alternatively the concept of a single sentinel node may need to be reconsidered: in rugby
terms we may need to ®nd not just the hooker but the

1087

entire front row. Selective sampling may hold the key to
avoidance of false-negative studies.
The often uncritical acceptance of a new surgical
operation, sentinel node sampling, can be contrasted
with the widespread lack of interest in timing of surgery
in premenopausal women [34]. Sentinel node biopsy will
not save one life, indeed some may be lost by understaging. Re-scheduling surgery to the luteal phase costs
nothing and carries no cachet of surgical technical
achievement but if applied in Europe could potentially
save 5000 lives annually. Meta-analyses have con®rmed
the signi®cance of the reduction of mortality amongst
women undergoing luteal phase surgery. The
benefit of luteal phase surgery has also been demonstrated by direct hormone measurements in that women
with serum progesterone >4 ng/ml had a signi®cantly
better survival than those with a serum progesterone
44 ng/ml. This has implications much more wideranging than mere timing of surgery: it indicates that
peri-operative events may have a major impact on subsequent survival and gives a rationale for the concept of
peri-operative endocrine therapy. Although cure of
breast cancer may result in part from the use of appropriate postoperative adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy
and endocrine treatment, there is still a major potential
place for peri-operative endocrine manipulations to
reduce the mortality from early breast cancer.
