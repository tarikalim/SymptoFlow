Summary (Lancet Oncol 2022; 23: 382–92)
Background:
For women with early‐stage oestrogen receptor (ER)‐positive breast cancer, adjuvant tamoxifen reduces 15‐year breast cancer mortality by about one third. Aromatase inhibitors are more effective than tamoxifen in postmenopausal women but are ineffective in premenopausal women when used without ovarian suppression. This meta‐analysis investigates whether premenopausal women treated with ovarian suppression benefit from aromatase inhibitors.

Methods:
An individual patient data meta‐analysis was performed using data from four randomised trials (ABCSG XII, SOFT, TEXT, and HOBOE) that included 7030 premenopausal women with ER‐positive tumours enrolled between June 17, 1999, and August 4, 2015. All participants received ovarian suppression (via goserelin, triptorelin, or ovarian ablation) and were randomised to receive either an aromatase inhibitor (anastrozole, exemestane, or letrozole) or tamoxifen for 3 or 5 years. Data on baseline characteristics, breast cancer recurrence (distant, locoregional, or contralateral), second primary cancers, and mortality were collected. Primary outcomes included breast cancer recurrence, breast cancer mortality, death without recurrence, and all‐cause mortality, with distant recurrence analyzed separately.

Findings:
The median follow‐up was 8.0 years (IQR 6.1–9.3). Women allocated to an aromatase inhibitor had a lower rate of breast cancer recurrence compared with those assigned tamoxifen (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69–0.90; p=0.0005). The main benefit was observed in years 0–4 (RR 0.68, 99% CI 0.55–0.85; p<0.0001), with a 3.2% absolute reduction in 5‐year recurrence risk (6.9% vs 10.1%). No additional benefit or loss was seen in years 5–9 (RR 0.98, 99% CI 0.73–1.33; p=0.89) or beyond 10 years. Distant recurrence was reduced with aromatase inhibitors (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71–0.97; p=0.018). There were no significant differences in breast cancer mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.82–1.24; p=0.94), death without recurrence (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.75–2.25; p=0.34), or all‐cause mortality (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.86–1.27; p=0.68). However, bone fractures were more frequent with aromatase inhibitors (6.4% vs 5.1%; RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.04–1.54; p=0.017). Non–breast cancer deaths and endometrial cancer incidences were low.

Interpretation:
For premenopausal women with early‐stage ER‐positive breast cancer receiving ovarian suppression, using an aromatase inhibitor instead of tamoxifen reduces the risk of breast cancer recurrence. Longer follow‐up is needed to determine any impact on mortality.

Introduction:
Adjuvant tamoxifen for 5 years reduces 15‐year breast cancer mortality by approximately one third in women with early‐stage hormone receptor–positive breast cancer. Aromatase inhibitors, which block the conversion of androgens into oestrogens, have demonstrated superior efficacy to tamoxifen in postmenopausal women. However, in premenopausal women the ovarian production of oestrogen negates the effect of aromatase inhibitors unless ovarian suppression or ablation is also employed. This study explores whether premenopausal women benefit from the addition of an aromatase inhibitor to ovarian suppression compared with tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression.

Research in Context:
Previous meta-analyses in postmenopausal women have shown that aromatase inhibitors reduce recurrence rates by about 30% compared with tamoxifen. Given the uncertainty in premenopausal women without ovarian suppression, this collaborative meta-analysis of individual patient data from four trials aims to define the benefits and risks when ovarian suppression is added.

Methods:
The study followed standard protocols for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of individual patient data. Eligible trials began before January 1, 2010, and involved premenopausal women with ER‐positive operable breast cancer randomized to receive either an aromatase inhibitor plus ovarian function suppression or tamoxifen plus ovarian function suppression. Data collected included demographics, tumour characteristics, recurrence (locoregional, distant, or contralateral), second primary cancers, bone fractures, and mortality. Time-to-event analyses were performed using stratified log-rank tests and Kaplan–Meier estimates, with treatment effects expressed as rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals.

Added Value of This Study:
By analyzing individual patient data from 7030 premenopausal women, this meta-analysis demonstrates that aromatase inhibitors significantly reduce recurrence rates compared with tamoxifen, particularly in the first 4 years of treatment. The 5-year absolute risk reduction was 3.2%, and a significant reduction in distant recurrence was noted, although no significant difference in breast cancer mortality or all‐cause mortality was found at a median follow-up of 8 years.

Implications:
For premenopausal women with early-stage ER-positive breast cancer undergoing ovarian suppression, aromatase inhibitors offer a recurrence benefit compared with tamoxifen without increasing non–breast cancer mortality. The long-term impact on overall survival requires further follow-up, and the management of treatment-related side effects remains important.
