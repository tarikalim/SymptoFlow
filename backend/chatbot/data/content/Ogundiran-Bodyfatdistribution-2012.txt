Detailed Overview
Background and Rationale

    Global and Local Context:
        Breast cancer incidence is rising in developing countries such as Nigeria.
        Although overall obesity is an established risk factor for breast cancer, the role of fat distribution—particularly central (abdominal) obesity—remains less clear.
        African populations may have different patterns of fat deposition compared with Western populations, with some evidence suggesting lower visceral fat for a given BMI.

    Study Objective:
        To investigate the relationship between body fat distribution—measured by waist circumference, hip circumference, and waist/hip ratio (WHR)—and the risk of invasive breast cancer in Nigerian women.
        To determine whether central adiposity independently affects breast cancer risk, after adjusting for overall obesity (BMI) and other confounders.

Methods

    Study Design:
        A case-control study conducted between 1998 and 2009.
        Cases: 1,233 women with invasive breast cancer diagnosed at the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria.
        Controls: 1,101 community women from a demographically similar area.

    Data Collection:
        Structured questionnaires administered by trained research nurses captured demographic, reproductive, and lifestyle information (e.g., age, ethnicity, education, family history, reproductive history, hormone use, alcohol consumption).
        Anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist and hip circumferences) were obtained following the WHO MONICA guidelines.
        BMI was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height squared (m²).

    Statistical Analysis:
        Logistic regression models were used to compute odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between anthropometric measures and breast cancer risk.
        Models were adjusted for multiple potential confounders (age, ethnicity, education, reproductive factors, family history, benign breast disease, hormonal contraceptive use, alcohol consumption, and height).
        Additional adjustments were made for BMI and hip circumference when assessing waist circumference and WHR.
        Multiple imputation methods were used to address missing data, and interactions (e.g., between WHR and BMI) were examined.

Results

    Waist Circumference:
        Women in the highest quartile (90–138 cm) had a significantly higher breast cancer risk compared with those in the lowest quartile (45–73 cm).
        In the overall analysis, the adjusted OR for the highest versus lowest quartile was 2.39 (95% CI: 1.59–3.60; p-trend <0.001).
        Similar trends were seen in both premenopausal and postmenopausal subgroups, although the magnitude varied slightly.

    Hip Circumference:
        An inverse association was observed: higher hip circumference was linked to a reduced breast cancer risk.
        The adjusted OR for women with hip circumference >108 cm compared to those with 54–92 cm was 0.36 (95% CI: 0.24–0.55; p-trend <0.001).

    Waist/Hip Ratio (WHR):
        A strong positive association was noted: women in the highest quartile of WHR (>0.87) had an adjusted OR of 2.15 (95% CI: 1.61–2.85; p-trend <0.001) compared with women in the lowest quartile (<0.77).
        This association was consistent in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women.

    Interaction with BMI:
        There was a significant interaction between WHR and BMI (p-interaction = 0.016).
        Among women with a BMI <25 kg/m² (normal weight), the risk associated with a high WHR was stronger (adjusted OR ≈ 2.81) compared with overweight/obese women (BMI ≥25 kg/m²), where the adjusted OR was approximately 1.70.

Conclusions

    Central Adiposity as a Risk Factor:
        Central obesity—captured by waist circumference and WHR—is significantly associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in Nigerian women, independent of overall obesity.
        The effect of a high WHR is particularly pronounced in women with a normal BMI, indicating that even among women who are not overweight overall, the pattern of fat distribution (i.e., greater abdominal fat) may elevate risk.

    Protective Role of Hip Circumference:
        In contrast, greater hip circumference appears to be inversely related to breast cancer risk, suggesting that lower body fat or subcutaneous fat may have a protective effect.

    Implications for Public Health and Future Research:
        These findings underscore the importance of assessing fat distribution, not just overall obesity, when evaluating breast cancer risk—especially in populations with differing body composition profiles.
        The study contributes valuable data from an indigenous African population, highlighting potential avenues for targeted prevention strategies and risk assessment tools.
        Future studies are needed to further elucidate the biological mechanisms behind these associations and to explore the role of central adiposity in breast cancer across diverse populations.

Limitations

    Study Design:
        As a case-control study, it is subject to potential recall and measurement biases.
    Measurement Limitations:
        Waist and hip circumferences are indirect measures of visceral fat; more precise methods (e.g., imaging) might further clarify the association.
    Generalizability:
        Findings are specific to the Nigerian population studied and may differ in other ethnic or geographical contexts.
