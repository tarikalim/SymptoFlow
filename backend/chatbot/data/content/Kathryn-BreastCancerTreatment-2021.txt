Breast Cancer Treatment

Breast cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer in women worldwide, and the second most
common cause of death from cancer in women in the United States. Risk assessment tools can identify
the risk of breast cancer, and patients at high risk may be candidates for risk-reducing medications. The
choice of medication varies with menopausal status. Breast cancer treatment depends on the stage.
Stage 0 is ductal carcinoma in situ, which is noninvasive but progresses to invasive cancer in up to 40%
of patients. Ductal carcinoma in situ is treated with lumpectomy and radiation or with mastectomy. If
ductal carcinoma in situ is estrogen receptor–positive, patients may also receive endocrine therapy.
Early invasive stages (I, IIa, IIb) and locally advanced stages (IIIa, IIIb, IIIc) are nonmetastatic and have
three treatment phases. The preoperative phase uses systemic endocrine or immunotherapies when
tumors express estrogen, progesterone, or ERBB2 receptors. Preoperative chemotherapy may also be
used and is the only option when tumors have none of those three receptors. There are two options for
the surgical phase with similar survival rates;​a lumpectomy with radiation if the tumor can be excised
completely with good cosmetic results, or a mastectomy. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is also performed
when there is suspected nodal disease. The postoperative phase includes radiation, endocrine therapy,
immunotherapy, and chemotherapy. Postmenopausal women should also be offered postoperative
bisphosphonates. Stage IV (metastatic) breast cancer is treatable but not curable. Treatment goals
include improving the length and quality of life. (Am Fam Physician. 2021;​104(2):​171-178. Copyright ©

Breast cancer is the second most common can- Breast Cancer Risk Factors and Riskcer diagnosed in women, exceeded only by nonmelanoma skin cancer. It is the leading cause of death
from cancer in women worldwide. In the United
States, breast cancer is the second most common
cause of death from cancer in women, exceeded
only by lung cancer, with approximately 316,000
patients diagnosed with breast cancer annually.1,2
The treatment of breast cancer requires a multidisciplinary team of specialists in medical, surgical, and radiation oncology. Because most breast
cancers are identified by mammography or by
physical examination, primary care physicians
are often the first contact for patients with a new
breast cancer diagnosis.3 Primary care physicians
should be familiar with the diagnostic workup
for breast cancer and the basics of treatment.3

BREAST CANCER TREATMENT

Patients with estrogen receptor–positive DCIS and residual breast tissue should receive five years of endocrine
therapy. This treatment includes tamoxifen if the patient is
premenopausal and tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor if
postmenopausal.24

a malignancy. However, despite its name, it is not a carcinoma and is a proliferative disease that confers an increased
risk of future breast cancer. It is no longer included in breast

disease. Chemotherapeutic drugs are the only systemic
therapy available for patients with triple-negative breast
cancer.24
Preoperative therapy with trastuzumab (Herceptin)
and/or pertuzumab (Perjeta), which are monoclonal antibodies directed against ERBB2, is used in addition to chemotherapy when the cancer is ERBB2 positive.
Patients with low-risk estrogen receptor–positive disease,
or older adults, may be eligible for preoperative systemic
therapy alone, without proceeding to surgery.
A complete response (i.e., the tumor is no longer detectable) to preoperative systemic therapies is associated with
favorable outcomes for disease-free survival and overall
survival.24 The degree of tumor response to preoperative systemic therapies helps determine the need for and response
to any postoperative systemic therapies.

PREOPERATIVE SYSTEMIC THERAPY

The purpose of preoperative systemic therapy is to decrease the size
of resectable breast tumors (allowing
for better cosmetic and treatment outcomes), to render unresectable tumors
operable, and to allow for SLN biopsy
instead of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) if axillary nodes are no
longer detectable. Generally, preoperative therapy is not recommended for

the excised tissue is sent to pathology, the specimen’s outer
surface is marked with ink. A specimen devoid of cancer
cells adjacent to the inked surface is considered a negative
margin.28
Some tumors may be too large to allow for good cosmesis with lumpectomy and will require a mastectomy. Some
women may choose mastectomy over lumpectomy for many
other reasons, including family history, gene mutations,
peace of mind, or lack of access to health care centers offering radiation therapy.29
In addition to removing the tumor, surgical interventions can also address the potential spread of breast cancer
through the lymphatic system. SLN biopsy is done by injecting tracer into the breast and removing the first several axillary nodes into which the tracer drains. An SLN biopsy is
preferred over ALND for patients without clinical evidence
of nodal disease or with a low nodal burden based on imaging studies.30
The removal of more lymph nodes and adipose tissue
of the axilla by ALND is reserved for patients who have

positive nodes on SLN biopsy and will have a mastectomy,
patients with inflammatory breast cancer (a rare but aggressive cancer that causes redness and swelling of the breast),
and patients with positive nodes after preoperative chemotherapy. SLN biopsy does not confer an increased risk of
death compared with ALND.31
POSTOPERATIVE THERAPY

Radiation. Radiation therapy is used after surgical excision
of breast cancer to eliminate any remaining subclinical disease. It is generally recommended for patients who have had
a lumpectomy and for patients with high-risk, node-positive
disease who have been treated with mastectomy.4 For
patients who have a lumpectomy, radiation decreases the
20-year, ipsilateral breast cancer recurrence rate.32
Partial breast irradiation, which involves treating only
the site of lumpectomy and surrounding tissue, requires
fewer radiation sessions and decreases acute skin toxicity
without increasing the risk of local recurrence.33,34 There is
evidence to suggest that whole breast radiation therapy may
result in better long-term cosmetic
results than partial breast irradiation.34
Shared clinical decision-making for
radiation should consider patient life
expectancy, tumor response to preoperative systemic therapies, and nodal
involvement.35

hormone receptor–positive, ERBB2-negative breast cancer
with a high risk of recurrence.37 After five years of tamoxifen therapy, patients who are premenopausal and originally received tamoxifen receive an additional five years of
tamoxifen, and patients who originally received tamoxifen
and are now postmenopausal may receive tamoxifen or an
aromatase inhibitor for an additional five years. Premenopausal patients who were originally treated with aromatase
inhibitors may receive an additional three to five years of
aromatase inhibitor therapy.24
Women who are postmenopausal at the time of their
breast cancer diagnosis may receive up to 10 years total of
endocrine therapy. This may consist of tamoxifen alone, an
aromatase inhibitor alone, or a sequence of the two medications. GnRH is not necessary after menopause.
Targeted. Approximately 15% to 20% of breast cancers
involve overexpression of ERBB2.38 These cancers have a
poor prognosis;​however, outcomes are improved with chemotherapy in conjunction with trastuzumab administered
every three weeks for one year.38 There is no increase in
long-term, disease-free survival with more than one year of
therapy.38
Patients with high-risk ERBB2-positive breast cancer
determined by larger tumor size and positive nodal status
may benefit from additional agents such as pertuzumab,
and neratinib (Nerlynx), an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor
that acts on ERBB2-expressing cells. Treatment with therapies in addition to a trastuzumab-containing regimen has
demonstrated a small increase in three-year disease-free
survival and five-year disease-free survival for pertuzumab
and neratinib, respectively.39,40
Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is used to decrease tumor
size before surgery,24 and is administered after surgery to
treat breast cancers that express hormone receptors and
ERBB2. Chemotherapy is a core treatment for triple-negative
breast cancer because endocrine therapy and immunotherapy have no benefit.4,24 Taxane-based, nonanthracycline
regimens are used for lower-risk disease, and anthracyclines
are included in regimens that target triple-negative cancers
with lymph node involvement.41 There are data supporting
the use of capecitabine (Xeloda) for triple-negative cancers
with lymph node involvement if residual disease is present
at the time of surgery.42
Other Treatments. Postmenopausal women who receive
postoperative aromatase inhibitor therapy for nonmetastatic breast cancer should be offered bisphosphonate therapy, which appears to decrease the chance of developing
bone metastases and fractures and improves survival.24,43,44
Before starting bisphosphonate therapy, patients should
undergo a dental examination and should be taking vitamin D and calcium supplements.24
176 American Family Physician

Stage IV, Metastatic Breast Cancer
The median survival rate for patients with metastatic
breast cancer has improved over the past several decades
with advances in breast cancer therapies. Although metastatic breast cancer is rarely cured, survival is now 24 to 40
months.45
The goals of treatment focus on minimizing symptoms,
extending life, and preserving quality of life.4 Endocrine
therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy may all be
offered to target their respective appropriate breast cancer
subtypes. Surgery or radiation following systemic therapy
may be appropriate for patients in which tumor burden
affects quality of life.46
The 60% to 80% of patients with advanced breast cancer who develop metastases to the bones should be offered
treatment with denosumab (Prolia) or bisphosphonates
such as zoledronic acid (Reclast) or pamidronate (Aredia).24 These therapies have been shown to decrease the
effects of metastases on the bone, such as fractures and
hypercalcemia.47
Metastases to the liver, lung, and brain are common in
stage IV breast cancer.48,49 Symptomatic treatments should
be recommended as needed to provide palliation.
Recurrent Breast Cancer
The treatment of recurrent breast cancer requires a multidisciplinary approach that considers all potential options
for optimal outcomes.24 For locally recurrent breast cancer initially treated with breast-conserving therapy (i.e.,
lumpectomy plus radiation), additional radiation is not
recommended;​total mastectomy is the standard of care.24
However, a 2017 study demonstrated promising data that
local resection followed by partial breast reirradiation could
be an appropriate alternative treatment approach.50
Local recurrence following a mastectomy usually involves
the chest wall and requires wide local excision. If the patient
did not previously receive radiation, surgical resection followed by radiation therapy is recommended.51
For regional recurrence involving the axillary lymph
nodes, surgical resection and radiation therapy are recommended. Radiation therapy without surgery is the standard of care for supraclavicular or internal mammary node
recurrence.
The treatment of recurrent disease with distant metastases (i.e., stage IV) is guided by estrogen, progesterone, and ERBB2 receptor status. Treatment algorithms
include additional endocrine therapy, chemotherapy,
and ERBB2-targeted therapies. Regular assessments with
shared decision-making should be implemented to assess
ongoing treatment in the setting of palliative and supportive care.
