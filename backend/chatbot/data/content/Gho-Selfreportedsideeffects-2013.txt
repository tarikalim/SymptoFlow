Overview

This study investigates the self-reported side effects experienced by breast cancer patients following treatment. It examines the incidence of these side effects, their associations with patient characteristics, and evaluates the potential mitigating influence of exercise. With an emphasis on quality of life (QOL), the research aims to identify key factors that may inform post-treatment care strategies.
Purpose

The primary objectives of the study were to:

    Quantify the incidence of various side effects reported by breast cancer survivors.
    Explore associations between these side effects and patient characteristics (such as age, type of surgery, and treatment status).
    Determine the influence of current exercise levels on the severity of side effects.

Methods

    Study Design & Participants:
    A cross-sectional online survey was administered to 432 breast cancer patients who were members of the Breast Cancer Network Australia (BCNA) Review group or affiliated with the Cancer Councils of Victoria or Western Australia. Participants were required to be over 18 years old and have a history of breast cancer.

    Data Collection:
    The survey collected detailed information on:
        Demographics and treatment history (including type of surgery and current treatment status).
        Current exercise levels, assessed using the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire Version 2 (GPAQ2) to derive metabolic equivalents (METs) and classify physical activity into “sufficiently active” versus “insufficiently active.”
        Self-reported side effects experienced within the past two weeks, using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from “none” to “severe” for symptoms such as hot flushes, sleep disorders, aching muscles, fatigue, shoulder limitations, pain, muscular chest wall pain, weight gain, depression, arm lymphedema, and others.

    Statistical Analysis:
    Binary logistic regression models were used to analyze the association between patient characteristics (age, surgery type, treatment status, and exercise levels) and the likelihood of experiencing each side effect. For each symptom, responses were dichotomized into “no symptom experience” (Likert score = 1) versus “any level of experience” (Likert score = 2–5). Analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows (Version 17.0).

Results

    General Findings:
    The survey revealed a broad range of side effects with varying incidence:
        Common side effects included hot flushes, sleep disorders, aching muscles, fatigue, and weight gain.
        Participants currently undergoing treatment were more likely to report hot flushes, aching muscles, and weight gain compared to those who had completed treatment.
        Women who had undergone a lumpectomy reported fewer side effects (including less aching muscle, hot flushes, and weight gain) than those who had a mastectomy.

    Influence of Exercise:
    Sufficient levels of exercise were consistently associated with a reduced likelihood of experiencing several side effects. For example:
        Women who were sufficiently active had lower odds of weight gain (OR = 2.29; 95% CI 1.44–3.64) compared to those who were insufficiently active.
        Similar protective associations were observed for shoulder limitations (OR = 1.77; 95% CI 1.14–2.77), breathlessness (OR = 2.30; 95% CI 1.35–3.92), and muscular chest wall pain (OR = 1.69; 95% CI 1.07–2.65).

    Other Associations:
        The type of surgery (lumpectomy versus mastectomy) and whether a patient was currently undergoing treatment were significantly related to the experience of several side effects.
        Age was not found to be strongly associated with side effect severity in this study.

Conclusions

The study concludes that:

    A significant number of breast cancer survivors experience various treatment-related side effects, which can adversely impact quality of life.
    Patient characteristics, including the type of surgery and current treatment status, are important predictors of side effect experience.
    Importantly, sufficient levels of exercise are consistently associated with a reduced incidence and severity of several side effects.
    These findings underscore the potential for exercise-based interventions to improve post-treatment quality of life among breast cancer survivors.

Implications for Practice

    For Healthcare Providers:
    Integrating exercise programs into post-treatment care could help mitigate some of the negative side effects experienced by breast cancer survivors. Tailoring interventions based on individual patient characteristics may enhance treatment adherence and improve overall outcomes.

    For Researchers:
    Further research is needed to explore causal relationships and to determine the optimal types and intensities of exercise that yield the most benefit for reducing treatment-related side effects.
