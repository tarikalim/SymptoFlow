### 1. Introduction and Motivation

Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality among women worldwide. Early detection via medical imaging—especially mammography—is critical for improving treatment outcomes. However, the automated analysis of mammograms is challenging due to the sheer volume of images and the pronounced class imbalance in available datasets (with normal cases far outnumbering cancerous ones). This study addresses these challenges by proposing an innovative approach that combines region-of-interest (ROI) extraction with an oversampling technique (SMOTE Tomek Link) to enhance deep learning-based breast cancer detection.

### 2. Background and Related Work

Traditional methods for automated breast cancer detection often rely on patch-based techniques that divide an entire image into smaller segments. Although such methods can capture fine-grained details, they tend to be computationally intensive and may include many irrelevant regions. In contrast, ROI-based approaches aim to isolate only the most critical parts of an image—areas most likely to contain abnormalities—thereby reducing computational overhead and potentially improving detection accuracy.

Previous studies have also highlighted the challenges posed by class imbalance in medical imaging. Techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) have been employed to generate synthetic minority class examples, while Tomek Link removal helps in cleaning overlapping or noisy samples. By integrating both strategies, researchers have demonstrated improved performance in various classification tasks. This paper builds on these ideas by applying them specifically to the RSNA screening mammography dataset.

### 3. Methodology

#### 3.1 Dataset Description

The study utilizes the RSNA screening mammography breast cancer detection dataset, which comprises over 54,000 mammographic images from approximately 11,000 patients. Each patient’s data includes multiple views taken from different angles, along with essential metadata (such as age, BIRADS scores, and breast density). For deep learning purposes, the original DICOM images are resized to 512×512 pixels and converted to 8-bit grayscale. The dataset is known for its high imbalance; only about 1.8% of the images represent cancerous cases.

#### 3.2 ROI Extraction

The proposed method focuses on extracting regions of interest (ROIs) from the mammograms to isolate areas where abnormalities are likely to occur. This process involves:
- **Grayscale Conversion:** Simplifying the image by removing color information.
- **Thresholding and Pixel Filtering:** Identifying and selecting pixels above a certain threshold.
- **Object Selection and Cropping:** Isolating specific regions that are most indicative of cancerous tissue.
- **Resizing:** Adjusting the ROI to a standard dimension (e.g., 400×250 pixels) to reduce computational complexity while preserving essential features.

By concentrating on these critical regions, the model can avoid processing irrelevant areas and potentially improve its focus on detecting subtle abnormalities.

#### 3.3 Handling Class Imbalance with SMOTE Tomek Link

To address the skewed class distribution, the study applies a hybrid resampling approach:
- **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique):** Generates synthetic samples for the minority (cancer) class by interpolating between existing minority examples.
- **Tomek Link Removal:** Identifies and removes borderline instances where minority and majority class samples are too similar, thereby cleaning the dataset and sharpening the decision boundaries.

The paper explores three different dataset splits:
- **Split 1:** A 5:1 ratio (normal to cancer cases).
- **Split 2:** A 3:1 ratio.
- **Random Under-Sampling (RUS):** A fully balanced dataset created by reducing the number of majority class samples.

#### 3.4 Deep Learning Models and Experimental Setup

Several pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures are fine-tuned for the detection task. These include:
- InceptionV3
- InceptionResNetV2
- ResNet152V2
- DenseNet201
- EfficientNetB7

The experimental setup involves:
- **Data Splitting:** Allocating 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing, with 10% of the training set used for validation.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Using a learning rate of 0.0001, a batch size of 32, and training for 100 epochs with the Adam optimizer and ReLU activation function.
- **Hardware:** Experiments are conducted on a DGX A100 server with GPU acceleration, ensuring efficient processing of high-resolution images.

### 4. Experimental Results

#### 4.1 Impact of ROI Extraction

The study shows that applying ROI extraction has a significant effect on model performance for imbalanced splits. For example:
- On Data Split 1, accuracy improved from approximately 55–58% (without ROI) to around 82–86% (with ROI).
- For Data Split 2, a similar improvement is observed, with accuracy rising markedly when only the ROIs are used. In contrast, for the RSNA original and RUS datasets, where either the imbalance is extreme or the data is already balanced, ROI extraction does not offer significant gains.

#### 4.2 Effectiveness of SMOTE Tomek Link Oversampling

When combined with the CNN models, the SMOTE Tomek Link technique further enhances performance:
- For Data Split 1, accuracy increased from 70.91% (without ROI and oversampling) to 87.07% (with ROI and oversampling).
- For Data Split 2, the best performance was noted with the EfficientNetB7 model, achieving an accuracy of 97.41% after applying the oversampling technique.
- Precision metrics across various models also show slight improvements, highlighting that the hybrid oversampling method effectively addresses class imbalance and improves the reliability of the predictions.

#### 4.3 Comparison with Previous Studies

The paper compares its approach with prior studies:
- An earlier study using EfficientNet reported an accuracy of 95.6% without providing detailed recall or precision metrics.
- Another approach utilizing concatenated CNN features reached 92% accuracy with 96% recall.
- In contrast, the proposed method (EfficientNetB7 with ROI extraction and SMOTE Tomek Link) achieved a balanced performance across accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score—each approximating 97.41%.

These comparisons underscore the effectiveness of combining ROI-based detection with oversampling techniques in improving model performance.

### 5. Discussion

The integration of ROI extraction and SMOTE Tomek Link in this study offers several advantages:
- **Enhanced Focus:** By isolating critical areas of the mammograms, the model is better able to concentrate on regions that are most indicative of cancer, reducing noise and irrelevant information.
- **Improved Handling of Imbalance:** The hybrid oversampling method not only increases the representation of cancerous samples but also cleans the dataset by removing ambiguous cases, leading to a clearer decision boundary.
- **Computational Efficiency:** Focusing on ROIs reduces the amount of data processed, which in turn decreases computational load and training time.
- **Superior Performance:** The experimental results, especially for Data Split 2, demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional approaches and offers promising potential for clinical applications.

The paper also discusses limitations such as the need for further validation on larger, more diverse datasets and the potential benefits of incorporating additional data augmentation techniques to further enhance model robustness.

### 6. Conclusion

In conclusion, the study presents a novel ROI-based approach combined with SMOTE Tomek Link oversampling for the detection of breast cancer in mammographic images. The methodology effectively addresses the challenges posed by large image volumes and severe class imbalance. With significant improvements observed in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score—especially using the EfficientNetB7 model—the approach sets a new benchmark for deep learning-based breast cancer detection. The findings suggest that by concentrating on critical regions and balancing the dataset, automated systems can achieve high diagnostic performance, which is essential for early detection and improved patient outcomes. Future work is encouraged to further refine these techniques and validate them in real-world clinical settings.
